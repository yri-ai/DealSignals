## Q4: What is the cash burn rate?

**Answer:**

- Cash used in operating activities (H1 2021): **$(1,159M)**
- Cash used in investing activities (H1 2021): **$(187M)**
- **Total burn (H1 2021): $(1,346M)**
- **Monthly burn rate: ~$224M/month**

**Calculation:**

```
Operating: $(1,158,957) + Investing: $(186,628) = $(1,345,585)
$(1,345,585) ÷ 6 months = $224M/month
```

## Q5: What is the cash runway at current burn rate?

**Answer:**

- Cash at end of H1 2021: **$855M**
- Monthly burn rate: **$224M**
- **Runway: ~3.8 months**

**Calculation:**

```
$855M ÷ $224M/month = 3.8 months
```

**Source:** S-4, Page 286 (cash balance), calculated runway

**Note:** WeWork required the SPAC proceeds to survive. Without the deal, they had less than 4 months of cash.

## Q6: What is the stated path to profitability and timeline?

**Answer:**
WeWork projected reaching **Adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2022** with $243M positive EBITDA.

| Year      | Revenue     | Adjusted EBITDA |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| 2020A     | $3,210M     | $(1,754M)       |
| 2021E     | $2,655M     | $(1,463M)       |
| **2022E** | **$4,348M** | **$243M**       |
| 2023E     | $5,650M     | $1,256M         |
| 2024E     | $6,785M     | $1,996M         |

**Source:** S-4, Page 147, "Current Projections"

**Note:** Initial projections showed 2022E EBITDA of $485M. This was revised down to $243M before the deal closed.

## Q7: What are the key assumptions underlying the projections?

**Answer:**

| Assumption            | 2020A | 2021E | 2022E | 2023E | 2024E |
| --------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Physical Occupancy    | 44%   | 74%   | 86%   | 87%   | 86%   |
| Total Occupancy       | 45%   | 81%   | 94%   | 101%  | 100%  |
| Physical Memberships  | 380k  | 541k  | 706k  | 776k  | 839k  |
| Total Memberships     | 387k  | 591k  | 772k  | 907k  | 937k  |
| Net ARPM              | $494  | $463  | $494  | $528  | $547  |
| Physical Workstations | 865k  | 730k  | 823k  | 894k  | 971k  |

**Source:** S-4, Page 147-148, "Key assumptions underlying the Current Projections"

**Red Flags:**

- Occupancy assumed to nearly double from 44% to 86% in two years
- Total occupancy of 101% in 2023 assumes "All Access" fills beyond physical capacity
- Revenue growth of 64% (2021→2022) projected while H1 2021 showed -39% YoY decline

## Q8: What is the contribution margin per membership?

**Answer:** **NEGATIVE**

| Metric                          | H1 2021     | Per Member/Month |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Revenue                         | $1,191M     | ~$441            |
| Location operating expenses     | $1,599M     | ~$592            |
| **Location-level contribution** | **$(408M)** | **$(151)**       |

WeWork loses approximately **$150/month per member** at the location level, before any corporate overhead (sales, G&A, etc.).

## Q9: What is the revenue per available desk/workstation?

**Answer:**

- Net ARPM (revenue per membership): **$463-494/month**
- Revenue per physical workstation: **~$3,600-3,700/year**

**Calculation:**

```
2020A: $3,210M revenue ÷ 865k workstations = $3,711/workstation/year
2021E: $2,655M revenue ÷ 730k workstations = $3,637/workstation/year
```

## Q10: What is the occupancy rate and trend?

**Answer:**

| Year  | Physical Occupancy | Total Occupancy | Trend                   |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2019A | 74%                | 74%             | Pre-COVID baseline      |
| 2020A | 44%                | 45%             | COVID collapse          |
| 2021E | 74%                | 81%             | Projected full recovery |
| 2022E | 86%                | 94%             | Projected growth        |

**Source:** S-4, Page 147

**Key Finding:** Occupancy crashed from 74% to 44% due to COVID. Projections assumed not just recovery but exceeding pre-COVID levels within 2 years.

## Summary of Key Red Flags (Pre-Deal)

1. **Revenue declining:** -38.6% H1 2021 vs H1 2020
2. **Negative unit economics:** Losing ~$150/member/month at location level
3. **<4 months runway:** Without SPAC cash, bankruptcy was imminent
4. **Aggressive assumptions:** 44%→86% occupancy in 2 years, 101% "total occupancy"
5. **Already revised down:** EBITDA projections cut in half before deal closed
6. **Cash burn accelerating:** Operating cash burn up 588% YoY
