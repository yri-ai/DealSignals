We know the “right thing” is a deliberate action we must always take, and that 
it is based on integrity and builds trust with those who we are about, including 
our people, members, and our community.
We’ve always believed that we are better together. We must operate with a 
shared purpose to constantly improve and grow and to become better as 
individuals, as teams, and as a company.
To reshape the way the world works, we must be bold, act with courage, and 
demonstrate the resiliency to push ahead no matter the odds or the 
circumstance.
We will not take anyone or anything for granted.  We are grateful for our people, 
members, and our greater community as well as for the opportunities we have 
in front of us.
Collaboration, kindness, and authenticity are essential to our humanity.  We 
must cherish each other and build a community that celebrates each person’s 
unique talents, passions, and backgrounds.
