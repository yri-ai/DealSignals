REGISTRATION FEE Title of each class of securities to be registered Amount to be registered (1) (2) Proposed maximum offering price per share security Proposed maximum aggregate offering price (3) Amount of registration fee (4) Shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share 646,133,747 N/A $21,537.79 $2.35 (5) (1) Based on the estimated maximum number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“BowX
Class A Common Stock”), of the registrant (“BowX”) to be issued to securityholders of WeWork Inc., a Delaware corporation (“WeWork”) in connection with the merger described herein in respect of outstanding WeWork common and
preferred stock plus shares of BowX Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for unvested and/or unexercised stock options (assuming the exercise price is paid for in cash) (regardless of whether such stock options are in or out of the
money), restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and warrants, respectively, at the closing of the business combination. The number of shares in this registration fee table are based on the exact expected exchange ratio as of September 14,
2021 (for example, rounded to seven decimal places rather than four decimal places the exchange ratio is expected to be 0.8256655) rather than the rounded expected exchange ratio of 0.8257 that is used elsewhere in this registration statement.
Specifically, this number includes the following number of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock: (A) 558,455,857 shares to holders of WeWork common and preferred stock (other than Class C common stock) and (B) 87,677,890 shares underlying unvested
and/or unexercised stock options (assuming the exercise price is paid for in cash) (regardless of whether such stock options are in or out of the money), restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and warrants. The sum of (A) 558,455,857 plus
(B) 87,677,890 equals the 646,133,747 shares that are being registered in this registration statement. Using the exact exchange ratio described above (rather than the exchange ratio rounded to four decimal places used elsewhere in this registration
statement), there are expected to be issued approximately 558,455,857 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock and 19,925,434 shares of Class C common stock to WeWork stockholders as of the closing of the business combination (not including shares of
BowX Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for unvested and/or unexercised stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, warrants and WeWork partnerships profits interest units). The exchange ratio is subject to
adjustment as further described in this registration statement. (2) Pursuant to Rule 416(a) of Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), there are also
being registered an indeterminable number of additional securities as may be issued to prevent dilution resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions. (3) Estimated solely for purposes of calculating the registration fee in accordance with Rule 457(f)(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). WeWork is a private company, no market exists for its securities, and WeWork has an accumulated deficit. Therefore, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price is one-third of the aggregate par value of the WeWork securities expected to be exchanged in the merger described herein, including WeWork securities convertible into WeWork capital stock. (4) Calculated pursuant to Rule 457 of the Securities Act by calculating the product of (i) the proposed
maximum aggregate offering price and (ii) 0.0001091. (5) Previously paid. The registrant hereby amends this registration statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the
registrant shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or until the registration
statement shall become effective on such date as the SEC, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine. Table of Contents The information in this preliminary proxy statement/prospectus is not complete and may
be changed. The registrant may not sell the securities described in this preliminary proxy statement/prospectus until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is declared effective. This preliminary proxy
statement/prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. PRELIMINARY PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED SEPTEMBER 16, 2021 BOWX ACQUISITION CORP. 2400 Sand Hill
Rd., Suite 200 Menlo Park, CA 94025 Dear BowX
Acquisition Corp. Stockholders: On March 25, 2021, BowX Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“BowX”), BowX Merger
Subsidiary Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of BowX, and WeWork Inc., a Delaware corporation (“WeWork”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other transactions, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub is to merge with and into WeWork (the “First Merger”), with WeWork surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of BowX (WeWork, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the First Merger, is sometimes referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”); and as promptly as practicable and as part of the same overall transaction as the First
Merger, such Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into BowX Merger Subsidiary II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub II”) and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BowX (the “Second Merger” and,
together with the First Merger, the “Mergers” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”), with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of the Second Merger
(Merger Sub II, in its capacity as the surviving entity of the Second Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the “Surviving Entity”). In connection with the Closing (as defined herein), BowX intends to change its name to WeWork Inc.
(such post-Closing entity, “New WeWork”). As a result of and upon the Closing, among other things, all outstanding shares
of WeWork Capital Stock (as defined herein) immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined herein) of the First Merger (other than the Excluded Shares (as defined herein)) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of an
aggregate of 655,300,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock (as defined herein) (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share) representing a pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately
$6.553 billion (the “Aggregate Merger Consideration”). The total shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock to be issued at the closing include shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock to be issued in respect of outstanding WeWork
Common Stock and WeWork Preferred Stock plus shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for unvested and/or unexercised in-the-money stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, WeWork Partnerships
Profits Interest Units other than WeWork Partnerships Profits Units with a catch-up base amount greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration (including corresponding shares of New WeWork Class C Common Stock), the WeWork Series C Convertible Note
and in-the-money warrants, respectively, at the Closing. Shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for out-of-the-money stock options and warrants are not included in the Aggregate Merger Consideration calculation. The
number of shares in the Aggregate Merger Consideration does not include both the number of shares of New WeWork Class C Common Stock and the number of related shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock. As of September 14, 2021, the exchange ratio is
expected to be approximately 0.8257 and there are expected to be issued approximately 558,479,201 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock and 19,926,267 shares of New WeWork Class C Common Stock to WeWork stockholders as of the Closing (using the
rounded exchange ratio of 0.8257 and not including shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for unvested and/or unexercised stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, warrants and WeWork Partnerships
Profits Interest Units). An additional 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock will be purchased (at a price of $10.00 per share) at the Closing by certain third-party investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), for a
total aggregate purchase price of $800,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment”). The proceeds of the PIPE Investment, together with the amounts remaining in BowX’s trust account as of immediately following the Effective Time, will be retained
by New WeWork following the Closing. See the section entitled “ The BCA Proposal ” of the attached proxy statement/prospectus for further information on the consideration payable to stockholders of WeWork. On March 25, 2021, BowX Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), BowX, WeWork, and certain other officers and directors of BowX (the
“Sponsor Persons”) entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), pursuant to which the Sponsor and Sponsor Persons agreed to, among other things, (i) cause to be forfeited 3,000,000 shares of
Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of BowX ( “BowX Class B Common Stock” and, together with BowX Class A Common Stock, “BowX Common Stock”), held by them and (ii) vote at least 9,454,534 shares
of Class B Common Stock in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Support Agreement. Table of Contents The BowX Units, BowX Class A Common Stock and public warrants are currently listed on
the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbols “BOWXU,” “BOWX,” and “BOWXW,” respectively. BowX intends to apply to continue the listing of the New WeWork Class A Common Stock and warrants on the NYSE under the
symbols “WE” and “WE WS,” respectively, upon the Closing. At the Closing, each unit will separate into its components consisting of one share of common stock and one-third of one redeemable
warrant and, as a result, will no longer trade as a separate security. BowX cordially invites you to attend a special meeting of its
stockholders in lieu of the 2021 annual meeting (the “special meeting”) to consider matters related to the proposed Business Combination. BowX and WeWork cannot complete the Mergers unless BowX’s stockholders consent to the approval
of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of New WeWork Class A Common Stock to be issued as the merger consideration. BowX is sending you this proxy statement/prospectus to ask you to vote in
favor of these and the other matters described in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to obtain stockholder approvals of the proposals necessary to complete the Business Combination, and these proposals are described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. The special meeting will be held
on                , 2021, at                local time, via a virtual meeting. In light
of the novel coronavirus (referred to as “COVID-19”) pandemic and to support the well-being of BowX’s stockholders and partners, the special meeting will be completely virtual. You may attend
the special meeting and vote your shares electronically during the special meeting via live webcast by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/bowxacquisitioncorp/sm2021. You will need the 12-digit meeting control
number that is printed on your proxy card to enter the special meeting. BowX recommends that you log in at least 15 minutes before the special meeting to ensure you are logged in when the special meeting starts. Please note that you will not be able
to attend the special meeting in person. As described in this proxy statement/prospectus, certain stockholders of WeWork are parties to a
support agreement with BowX whereby such stockholders agreed to vote all of their WeWork Capital Stock in favor of approving the Business Combination. In addition, WeWork will seek an irrevocable written consent of WeWork’s stockholders as required to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Business Combination contemplated thereunder. In the event WeWork determines it is not able to obtain written consent, WeWork will hold a meeting of WeWork stockholders for the purpose of voting to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Business Combination contemplated thereunder. Such approval requires (a) the holders of a majority of the shares of the WeWork Capital Stock outstanding; and (b) with respect to any transactions subject to Article Fifth,
Part A, Section 3.17 of WeWork’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Related Party Charter Provision”), the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding WeWork
Senior Preferred Stock that are not held by any SoftBank Party to affirmatively vote in favor of any such transactions. On March 25, 2021, in connection with execution of the Merger Agreement, BowX, WeWork and certain stockholders of WeWork
entered into Stockholder Support Agreements, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, such WeWork stockholders agreed to execute and deliver a written consent with respect to the outstanding shares of
WeWork Capital Stock held by the signing WeWork stockholders adopting the Merger Agreement and related transactions and approving the Business Combination (including consenting to enter into the Merger Agreement effective on March 25, 2021 for
purposes of the Related Party Charter Provision (as defined herein), to the extent applicable). Such written consent must be delivered promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours (or, in the case of SB WW Holdings (Cayman) Limited,
WeWork’s largest stockholder, five (5) calendar days) after (x) the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the approval by BowX stockholders of the Business Combination is declared effective by the SEC and delivered or otherwise made
available to BowX and WeWork stockholders, and (y) BowX or WeWork requests it. The shares of WeWork Common Stock and WeWork Preferred Stock that are owned by the Key Stockholders (as defined herein) and subject to the Stockholder Support
Agreements represent a majority of the outstanding voting power of WeWork Capital Stock (voting as a single class and on an as converted basis). The execution and delivery of such written consents by all of the stockholders of WeWork that have
entered into Stockholder Support Agreements will constitute the WeWork stockholder approval at the time of such delivery, and no Table of Contents additional approval or vote from any holders of any class or series of stock of WeWork will be necessary to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination. After careful consideration, the BowX board of directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the other proposals described in
this proxy statement/prospectus, and the BowX board of directors has determined that it is advisable to consummate the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors recommends that you vote “ FOR ” the
proposals described in this proxy statement/prospectus (including each of the sub-proposals). BowX is providing the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus and proxy card to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted
at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. Your vote is very important. If you are a registered stockholder, please vote your shares as soon as possible by signing, dating and returning
the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. If you hold your shares in “ street name ” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to
you by your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. More
information about BowX, WeWork and the Business Combination is contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. BowX and WeWork urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, including the financial statements and annexes and other
documents referred to herein, carefully and in their entirety. In particular, you should carefully consider the matters discussed in the section entitled “ Risk Factors ”
beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement/prospectus. TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST ELECT TO HAVE BOWX REDEEM

On behalf of our board of directors, I thank you for your support and look forward to the successful completion of the Business Combination.

are urged to read this proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the documents referred to ii Table of Contents herein, carefully and in their entirety. You should also carefully consider the risk factors described in the section entitled “ Risk
Factors ” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement/prospectus. After careful consideration, the
board of directors of BowX has unanimously approved the Business Combination and unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” adoption of the Merger Agreement, and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Business Combination, and “FOR” all other proposals presented to BowX’s stockholders in this proxy statement/prospectus. When you consider the recommendation of these proposals by the board of directors of BowX, you should keep in
mind that BowX’s directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Interests of
BowX ’ s Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination ” in this proxy statement/prospectus for a further discussion of these considerations. Pursuant to our Existing Charter, a holder of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock originally sold in our initial public offering,
including as part of the units issued in our initial public offering, (such stock the “public stock”) may request of BowX that BowX redeem all or a portion of such holder’s BowX Class A Common Stock for cash if the Business
Combination is consummated. As a holder of BowX Class A Common Stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any such shares to be redeemed only if you: (i) (a) hold BowX Class A Common Stock, or (b) if you hold BowX Class A Common Stock through units,
you elect to separate your units into the underlying BowX Class A Common Stock and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the BowX Class A Common Stock; (ii) submit a written request to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”),
BowX’s transfer agent, that BowX redeem all or a portion of your public stock for cash; and (iii) deliver your public stock to Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, physically or electronically through The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their BowX
Class A Common Stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on                , 2021, (two business days before the special meeting) in
order for their shares to be redeemed. Holders of units must elect to separate the units into the underlying BowX Class A
Common Stock and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the BowX Class A Common Stock. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they
elect to separate the units into the underlying BowX Class A Common Stock and public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, directly and instruct them to
do so. Public stockholders may elect to redeem BowX Class A Common Stock regardless of if or how they vote with respect to the BCA Proposal. If the Business Combination is not consummated, the public stock will be returned to the respective
holder, broker or bank. If the Business Combination is consummated, and if a public stockholder properly exercises its right to
redeem all or a portion of the BowX Class A Common Stock that it holds and timely delivers its shares to Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, New WeWork will redeem such BowX Class A Common Stock for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the pro rata portion of the trust account established at the consummation of our initial public offering (the “trust account”), calculated as of two
business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the trust account as of June 30, 2021, of approximately $483.1 million, the estimated per share redemption price would have been
approximately $10.00. If a public stockholder exercises its redemption rights in full, then it will be electing to exchange its BowX Class A Common Stock for cash and will no longer own BowX Class A Common Stock. The redemption takes place
following the Business Combination and, accordingly, it is shares of New WeWork Class A Common iii Table of Contents Stock that will be redeemed promptly after consummation of the Business Combination. See the section entitled “ Special Meeting of BowX — Redemption Rights ” in this proxy
statement/prospectus for a detailed description of the procedures to be followed if you wish to redeem your shares of public stock for cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such public stockholder or any other person with whom such
public stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its BowX Class A Common
Stock with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the BowX Class A Common Stock, without the consent of BowX. Accordingly, if a public stockholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the BowX
Class A Common Stock, then any such shares in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for cash. Our initial stockholders,
including the Sponsor, and our directors and officers have agreed to vote any shares of BowX Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Business Combination, including their shares of BowX Class B Common Stock and any public stock purchased
after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions). As a result, the parties to the Sponsor Support Agreement (as defined herein) agreed to, among other things, vote at least 9,454,534 shares of
Class B Common Stock in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Support Agreement. As of the record date, our initial stockholders,
including our Sponsor, and our directors and officers beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 18.6% of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Support Agreement, the BowX
Common Stock held by the Sponsor will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Sponsor owns
approximately 13% of the issued and outstanding BowX Common Stock. The Merger Agreement provides that the obligations of WeWork to
consummate the First Merger are conditioned on, among other things, that as of the Closing, the amount of cash available in the trust account as of the Closing, after deducting the amount required to satisfy BowX’s obligations to its
stockholders (if any) that exercise their redemption rights (but prior to the payment of any (i) deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account and (ii) transaction expenses of WeWork and BowX, or their affiliates (such
amount, the “Trust Amount”)) plus the PIPE Investment Amount actually received by BowX at or prior to the Closing Date, is at least equal to $800.0 million (the “Minimum Available Cash Condition”). The Minimum
Available Cash Condition is for the sole benefit of WeWork. If the Trust Amount when added to the PIPE Investment (such aggregate amount, the “Available Cash”) is equal to or greater than the Minimum Available Cash Condition amount, then
the Minimum Available Cash Condition will be deemed to have been satisfied. If such condition is not met, and such condition is not or cannot be waived under the terms of the Merger Agreement, then the Merger Agreement could terminate and the
proposed Business Combination may not be consummated. In addition, pursuant to the Organizational Documents, in no event will BowX redeem shares of public stock in an amount that would cause New WeWork’s net tangible assets (as determined in
accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) to be less than $5,000,001. The Merger
Agreement is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other closing conditions as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. There can be no assurance that the parties to the Merger Agreement would waive any such provision of the
Merger Agreement. The approval of the Organizational Documents Proposals (other than Organizational Documents Proposals A and D)
requires the affirmative vote (attending virtually or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock entitled to vote. The approval of Organizational Documents Proposals A and D will require the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of BowX Class A Common Stock on the record date and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock on the record date. The BCA Proposal
and Adjournment Proposal require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy, iv Table of Contents entitled to vote. The Stock Issuance Proposal, Equity Incentive Plan Proposal and the ESPP Proposal require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending
virtually or by proxy, entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. The approval of the election of each director nominee pursuant to the Director Election Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the
outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and voted at the special meeting. Because the Director Election Proposal is an uncontested election with no cumulative voting, every director nominee will be assured election
upon receiving just one “for” vote. Your vote is very important. Whether or not you
plan to virtually attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as possible by following the instructions in this proxy statement/prospectus to make sure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. The
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated only if the Condition Precedent Proposals are approved at the special meeting. Each of the Condition Precedent Proposals is cross-conditioned on the approval of each other. The
Adjournment Proposal is not conditioned upon the approval of any other proposal set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. If you
sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted FOR each of the proposals presented at the special meeting. If you fail to return your proxy card or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote, and do not attend the special meeting virtually, the effect will be, among other things, that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will not be voted.
An abstention or broker non-vote on any proposal will be counted toward the quorum requirement for the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and you attend the special meeting and wish to vote
virtually, you may withdraw your proxy and vote while attending virtually. Your attention is directed to the remainder of the proxy
statement/prospectus following this notice (including the Annexes and other documents referred to herein) for a more complete description of the proposed Business Combination and related transactions and each of the proposals. You are encouraged to

questions about the proposals to be presented at the special meeting, including with respect to the proposed Business Combination. The following questions and answers do not include all the information that is important to BowX’s stockholders.
BowX urges stockholders to carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus, including the financial statements and Annexes attached hereto and the other documents referred to herein. Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus? A: BowX has entered into the Merger Agreement with WeWork and the other parties thereto pursuant to which, among
other transactions, on the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub is to merge with and into WeWork, with WeWork surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of BowX; and as promptly as practicable and as part of the same
overall transaction as the First Merger, such Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of the Second Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex A. As a result of and upon the Closing, among other things, all outstanding shares of
WeWork Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares (as defined below)) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (at a deemed value of $10.00 per
share) representing a pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion. Additionally, as a result of and upon the Closing, in accordance with the applicable terms of the WeWork Warrants,
the WeWork Warrants will be converted into the right to receive a warrant to purchase shares of New WeWork Common Stock upon the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such WeWork Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
except that (i) such Converted New WeWork Warrant will relate to that whole number of shares of New WeWork Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of WeWork Capital Stock subject to such WeWork
Warrants, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share for each such Converted New WeWork Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of such WeWork Warrants in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent). An additional 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock will be purchased (at a price of $10.00 per
share) at the Closing by the PIPE Investors, for a total aggregate purchase price of $800,000,000. The proceeds of the PIPE Investment, together with the amounts remaining in BowX’s trust account as of immediately following the Effective Time,
will be retained by New WeWork following the Closing. For further details, see the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement — Consideration and Conversion of Certain WeWork Securities — Aggregate Merger
Consideration .” BowX stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon, among other proposals, a proposal to approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Business Combination. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal ” for more detail. BowX Units, BowX Class A Common Stock and public warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbols
“BOWXU,” “BOWX” and “BOWXW,” respectively. BowX intends to apply to continue the listing of BowX Class A Common Stock and warrants on the NYSE under the symbols “WE” and “WE WS,” respectively,
upon the Closing. At the Closing, each unit will separate into its components consisting of one share of BowX Class A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, and therefore there will be no
listing of the BowX Units following the consummation of the Business Combination. xviii Table of Contents THE VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT. STOCKHOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO VOTE AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE AFTER CAREFULLY REVIEWING THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, INCLUDING THE ANNEXES AND THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BOWX AND WEWORK, CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. Q: What matters will the stockholders consider at the special meeting? A: At the special meeting, BowX is asking holders of BowX Common Stock to consider and vote upon: • The BCA Proposal – a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination; • The Organizational Documents Proposals – four proposals to amend the Existing Charter; • The Director Election Proposal—a proposal to approve the election of nine directors, who, upon consummation
of the Business Combination, will be the directors of New WeWork; • The Stock Issuance Proposal – a proposal to approve, for purposes of complying with applicable listing rules
of Nasdaq, the issuance of (a) shares of BowX Class A Common Stock to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (b) shares of New WeWork Common Stock to the WeWork Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement; • The Equity Incentive Plan Proposal – a proposal to approve and adopt the 2021 Plan; • The ESPP Proposal – a proposal to approve and adopt the ESPP; and • The Adjournment Proposal – a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or
dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for the approval of one or more proposals at the special meeting. If BowX’s stockholders do not approve each of the Condition Precedent Proposals, then unless certain conditions in the Merger Agreement are waived by the
applicable parties to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement could terminate and the Business Combination may not be consummated. The applicable parties to the Merger Agreement would not be able to waive Organizational Documents Proposals A
or D and still complete the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement because there will not be a sufficient number of authorized shares of capital stock of BowX to issue the shares required to be issued in the Merger if
Organizational Documents Proposal A is not approved. See the sections entitled “ BCA Proposal ,” “ Organizational Documents Proposals ,” “ Director Election Proposal ,” “ Stock Issuance
Proposal ,” “ Equity Incentive Plan Proposal ,” “ ESPP Proposal ” and “ Adjournment Proposal. ” BowX will hold the special meeting to consider and vote upon these proposals. This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the
Business Combination and the other matters to be acted upon at the special meeting. Stockholders of BowX should read it carefully. After careful
consideration, BowX’s board of directors has determined that the BCA Proposal, each of the Organizational Documents Proposals, the Director Election Proposal, the Stock Issuance Proposal, the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal, the ESPP Proposal
and the Adjournment Proposal are in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote “FOR” each of those proposals. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of BowX’s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such director(s)
between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. In
addition, BowX’s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Interests of BowX ’ s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Business Combination ” for a further discussion of these considerations. Q: Are the proposals conditioned on one another? A: Yes. Each of the Condition Precedent Proposals are cross-conditioned on the approval of one another. The
Adjournment Proposal is not conditioned upon the approval of any other proposal. xix Table of Contents Q: What will happen upon the consummation of the Business Combination? A: On the Closing Date, Merger Sub will merge with and into WeWork, with WeWork surviving the First Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of BowX; and as promptly as practicable and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, such Surviving Corporation will be merged with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of
the Second Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. As a
result of and upon the Closing, among other things, all outstanding shares of WeWork Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share) representing a pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion. Additionally, as a result of and upon the
Closing, in accordance with the applicable terms of the WeWork Warrants, the WeWork Warrants will be converted into the right to receive a warrant to purchase shares of New WeWork Common Stock upon the same terms and conditions as are in effect with
respect to such WeWork Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time except that (i) such Converted New WeWork Warrant will relate to that whole number of shares of New WeWork Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to
the number of shares of WeWork Capital Stock subject to such WeWork Warrants, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share for each such Converted New WeWork Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
such WeWork Warrants in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent). An additional 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork
Class A Common Stock will be purchased (at a price of $10.00 per share) at the Closing by certain third-party investors, for a total aggregate purchase price of $800,000,000. The proceeds of the PIPE Investment, together with the amounts
remaining in BowX’s trust account as of immediately following the Effective Time, will be retained by New WeWork following the Closing. See the section entitled “ The BCA Proposal ” beginning of the attached proxy
statement/prospectus for further information on the consideration payable to stockholders of WeWork. Q: Why is BowX proposing the Business Combination? A: BowX was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. BowX is not limited to any particular industry or sector. BowX received $483,000,000 from its initial public offering (including net proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of its over-allotment
option) and sale of the private placement warrants, which was placed into the trust account immediately following the initial public offering. In accordance with the Existing Charter, the funds held in the trust account will be released upon the
consummation of the Business Combination. See the question entitled “ What happens to the funds deposited in the trust account after consummation of the Business Combination? ” There currently are 48,300,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B
Common Stock outstanding. In addition, there currently are 23,873,333 warrants issued and outstanding, consisting of 16,100,000 public warrants and 7,773,333 private placement warrants. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one
share of BowX Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a business combination, and expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of a
business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The private placement warrants, however, are non-redeemable so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Under the Existing Charter, BowX must provide all holders of public stock with the opportunity to have their public stock redeemed upon
the consummation of BowX’s initial business combination in conjunction with a stockholder vote. xx Table of Contents Q: What will WeWork Stockholders receive in return for BowX’s acquisition of all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of WeWork? A: As a result of and upon the Closing, among other things, all outstanding shares of WeWork Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share) representing a pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion. Additionally, as a result of and upon the Closing, in accordance with the applicable terms of the WeWork Warrants, the WeWork Warrants will be
converted into the right to receive a warrant to purchase shares of New WeWork Common Stock upon the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such WeWork Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time except that (i) such
Converted New WeWork Warrant will relate to that whole number of shares of New WeWork Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of WeWork Capital Stock subject to such WeWork Warrants, multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the exercise price per share for each such Converted New WeWork Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of such WeWork Warrants in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange
Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest full cent). An additional 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock will be purchased (at a price of $10.00 per share) at the Closing by certain
third-party investors, for a total aggregate purchase price of $800,000,000. The proceeds of the PIPE Investment, together with the amounts remaining in BowX’s trust account as of immediately following the Effective Time will be retained by New
WeWork following the Closing. See the section entitled “ The BCA Proposal ” in the attached proxy statement/prospectus for further information on the consideration payable to stockholders of WeWork. Q: What equity stake will current BowX stockholders and WeWork Stockholders hold in New WeWork immediately
after the consummation of the Business Combination? A: It is anticipated that, based on the assumptions set forth below, upon the consummation of the Business
Combination, the ownership of New WeWork will be as follows: Share Ownership in New WeWork (1) No Additional Redemptions Assuming Maximum Redemption Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares WeWork Stockholders 655,300,000 82.7 % 655,300,000 87.4 % Initial Stockholders 9,075,000 1.1 % 9,075,000 1.2 % BowX’s Public Stockholders (excluding PIPE Shares) 48,300,000 6.1 % 5,068,902 0.7 % PIPE Investors 80,000,000 10.1 % 80,000,000 10.7 % Total 792,675,000 100 % 749,443,902 100 % (1) The figures in this table are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the scenarios described
below, which may be different from the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but the number of shares
redeemed is less than 43,231,098, the ownership percentages set forth above will fall in between the two scenarios. For example, if we assume that the number of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock redeemed in connection with the Business Combination
total 21,615,549, BowX public stockholders will hold a total of 26,684,451 shares of New WeWork Common Stock at Closing, representing a 3.5% ownership interest. The numbers of shares of “New WeWork Common Stock Assuming No Redemption” set forth above assumes that no public stockholders elect
to have their public stock redeemed, and the numbers of shares of “New WeWork Common Stock Assuming Maximum Redemption” set forth above assumes that 43,231,098 shares of public stock are redeemed. xxi Table of Contents These numbers and percentages assume (i) (a) the vesting of all shares of New WeWork
Common Stock received in respect of the New WeWork Restricted Stock Awards, (b) the vesting and exercise of all in-the-money New WeWork Options for shares of New WeWork Common Stock, (c) the vesting of all New WeWork Restricted Stock Units and the
issuance of shares of New WeWork Common Stock in respect thereof, (d) the vesting and net exercise of all in-the-money warrants, and (e) that New WeWork issues shares of New WeWork Common Stock as the Aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which in the aggregate equals 655,300,000 shares of New WeWork Common Stock (assuming that all New WeWork Options are net-settled) and (ii) that New WeWork issues 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock
to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the PIPE Investment. In addition, the numbers of shares and percentage interests set forth above do not take into account certain potential future exercises of warrants or grants or issuances pursuant to the equity
incentive plan established to be effective after the Closing, or any other equity issuances of New WeWork. See the section entitled “Risk Factors – Public stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance
of New WeWork Common Stock as consideration in the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment and due to future issuances pursuant to the 2021 Plan, the First Warrant, the LC Warrant and the exercise of public warrants and private warrants. Having
a minority stock ownership position may reduce the influence that BowX’s current stockholders have on the management of New WeWork.” See the section entitled “Description of BowX Securities – Redeemable Warrants.” Shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for out-of-the-money stock options and warrants are not included in these numbers and percentages (or in the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration). These numbers and
percentages do not include both the number of shares of New WeWork Class C Common Stock and the number of related shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock. If the actual facts are different from these assumptions, the percentage ownership retained by the Company’s existing stockholders in the
combined company will be different. For example, if we assume that all of the 16,100,000 public warrants and 7,773,333 private placement warrants that will remain outstanding post-Business Combination were exercisable and exercised following
completion of the Business Combination in accordance with their terms, then the anticipated ownership of New WeWork at the Closing would be as follows: Share Ownership in New WeWork (1) No Additional Redemptions Assuming Maximum Redemption Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares WeWork Stockholders 655,300,000 80.3 % 655,300,000 84.7 % Initial Stockholders 16,848,333 2.1 % 16,848,333 2.2 % BowX’s Public Stockholders (excluding PIPE Shares) 64,400,000 7.9 % 21,168,902 2.7 % PIPE Investors 80,000,000 9.8 % 80,000,000 10.3 % Total 816,548,333 100 % 773,317,235 100 % For further details, see “ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement — Consideration — Aggregate Merger
Consideration .” (1) The figures in this table are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the scenarios described
below, which may be different from the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but the number of shares
redeemed is less than 43,231,098, the ownership percentages set forth above will fall in between the two scenarios. For example, if we assume that the number of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock redeemed in connection with the Business Combination
total 21,615,549, BowX public stockholders will hold a total of 42,784,451 shares of New WeWork Common Stock at Closing, representing a 5.4% ownership interest. Q: Will the Company obtain new financing in connection with the Business Combination? A: Yes. The PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase in the aggregate approximately 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork
Class A Common Stock, for $800,000,000 of gross proceeds, in the PIPE Investment. The PIPE Investment is contingent upon, among other things, the closing of the Business Combination. See “ BCA Proposal — Related Agreements —
Subscription Agreements .” xxii Table of Contents Q: Did the board of directors of BowX obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether
or not to proceed with the Business Combination? A: No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with
its determination to approve the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial
perspective to its stockholders. The BowX board of directors also determined, without seeking a valuation from a financial advisor, that WeWork’s fair market value was at least 80% of BowX’s net assets, excluding any taxes payable on
interest earned. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the judgment of the BowX board of directors as described above in valuing WeWork’s business and assuming the risk that the BowX board of directors may not have properly valued such
business. Q: Who will be the officers and directors of New WeWork if the Business Combination is consummated? A: The Merger Agreement provides that, immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, the New
WeWork board of directors will be comprised of nine directors: Marcelo Claure, Michel Combes, Bruce Dunlevie, Véronique Laury, Sandeep Mathrani, Deven Parekh, Vivek Ranadivé, Kirthiga Reddy and Jeff Sine. Immediately following the
consummation of the Business Combination, we expect that the following will be the executive officers of New WeWork: Sandeep Mathrani, Benjamin “Ben” Dunham, Anthony Yazbeck, Jared DeMatteis, Lauren Fritts, Peter Greenspan, Hamid Hashemi,
Maral Kazanjian, Scott Morey and Roger Solé Rafols. Concurrently with the consummation of the Business Combination, BowX’s officers and directors, other than Mr. Ranadivé (who will serve as a director of New WeWork following
the Business Combination), will resign from their respective positions at BowX. For more information on the management of New WeWork following the Business Combination, see the section entitled “ Management of New WeWork Following the
Business Combination. ” Q: Do WeWork Stockholders need to approve the Business Combination? A: Yes. On March 25, 2021, in connection with execution of the Merger Agreement, BowX, WeWork and certain
stockholders of WeWork entered into Stockholder Support Agreements, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, such WeWork Stockholders agreed to execute and deliver a written consent with respect to the
outstanding shares of WeWork Capital Stock held by the signing WeWork Stockholders adopting the Merger Agreement and related transactions and approving the Business Combination (including consenting to enter into the Merger Agreement effective on
March 25, 2021 for purposes of any transactions subject to Article Fifth, Part A, Section 3.17 of WeWork’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Related Party Charter Provision”), to the extent applicable). Such
written consent must be delivered promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours (or, in the case of SBWW, WeWork’s largest stockholder, five (5) calendar days) after (x) the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the
approval by BowX stockholders of the Business Combination is declared effective by the SEC and delivered or otherwise made available to BowX and WeWork Stockholders, and (y) BowX or WeWork requests it. The shares of WeWork Common Stock and
WeWork Preferred Stock that are owned by the Key Stockholders and subject to the Stockholder Support Agreements represent a majority of the outstanding voting power of WeWork Capital Stock (voting as a single class and on an as converted basis). The
execution and delivery of such written consents by all of the stockholders of WeWork that have entered into Stockholder Support Agreements will constitute the WeWork stockholder approval at the time of such delivery, and no additional approval or
vote from any holders of any class or series of stock of WeWork will be necessary to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination. Q: May BowX or BowX’s directors, officers or advisors, or their affiliates, purchase shares in connection
with the Business Combination? A: In connection with the stockholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination, the Sponsor, BowX’s
directors, BowX’s officers or BowX’s advisors or any of their affiliates may privately negotiate transactions to purchase shares prior to the Closing from stockholders who would have otherwise elected to have their shares redeemed in
conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules for a per xxiii Table of Contents share pro rata portion of the trust account without the prior written consent of WeWork. None of the Sponsor, BowX’s directors, BowX’s officers or BowX’s advisors, or their
respective affiliates, will make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller of such shares. Such a purchase would include a contractual
acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of such shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that the Sponsor, directors, officers or
advisors, or their affiliates, purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to
redeem their shares. Any such privately negotiated purchases may be effected at purchase prices that are in excess of the per share pro rata portion of the trust account. The purpose of these purchases would be to increase the amount of cash
available to BowX for use in the Business Combination. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of
BowX’s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself,
herself or themselves in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. In addition, BowX’s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. See the section entitled
“ BCA Proposal — Interests of BowX ’ s Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination ” for a further discussion of these considerations. Q: Do I have redemption rights? A: If you are a holder of public stock, you may redeem your public stock for cash equal to your pro rata share of
the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account, which holds the proceeds of the initial public offering, as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account and not previously released to BowX to pay its franchise and income taxes and for working capital purposes, upon the consummation of the Business Combination. The per share amount BowX will distribute to holders who properly redeem their
shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions BowX will pay to the underwriters of its initial public offering if the Business Combination is consummated. Holders of the outstanding public warrants do not have redemption rights
with respect to such warrants in connection with the Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their shares of BowX Class B Common Stock and any public stock that they
may have acquired during or after the initial public offering in connection with the completion of BowX’s initial business combination. The shares of BowX Class B Common Stock will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to
determine the per share redemption price. For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the trust account as of June 30, 2021, of approximately $483.1 million, the estimated per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.00. This
is greater than the $10.00 initial public offering price of BowX Units. Additionally, public stock properly tendered for redemption will only be redeemed if the Business Combination is consummated; otherwise holders of such shares will only be
entitled to a pro rata portion of the trust account (including interest but net of taxes payable and dissolution expenses) in connection with the liquidation of the trust account. If the Business Combination is not consummated, BowX may enter into
an alternative business combination and close such transaction by August 7, 2022 (subject to the requirements of law). The initial stockholders, including our Sponsor, and our directors and officers, have agreed to waive their redemption rights
with respect to all of the Founder Shares in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. The Founder Shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. Q: How do I exercise my redemption rights? A: If you are a public stockholder and wish to exercise your right to redeem the public stock, you must: (i) (a) hold public stock, or (b) if you hold public stock through units, you elect to separate your units
into the underlying public stock and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public stock; xxiv Table of Contents (ii) submit a written request to Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, that BowX redeem all or a portion of your
public stock for cash; and (iii) deliver your public stock to Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, physically or electronically through The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their shares of
public stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on             , 2021, (two business days before the special meeting) in order for their stock to be redeemed. The address of Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, is listed under the question “ Who can help answer my questions? ”
below. BowX requests that any request for redemption include the identity as to the beneficial owner making such request. Electronic delivery of your stock generally will be faster than delivery of physical stock certificates. Holders of units must elect to separate the units into the underlying public stock and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights
with respect to the public stock. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public stock and public warrants, or if a
holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact Continental directly and instruct them to do so. Public
stockholders will be entitled to request that their public stock be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us (net of taxes payable). For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the trust account as of June 30, 2021, of approximately $483.1 million, the estimated
per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.00. However, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of BowX’s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the public
stockholders, regardless of whether such public stockholder votes or, if they do vote, irrespective of if they vote for or against the BCA Proposal. Therefore, the per share distribution from the trust account in such a situation may be less than
originally expected due to such claims. Whether you vote, and if you do vote irrespective of how you vote, on any proposal, including the BCA Proposal, will have no impact on the amount you will receive upon exercise of your redemption rights. It is
expected that the funds to be distributed to public stockholders electing to redeem their public stock will be distributed promptly after the consummation of the Business Combination. Any request for redemption, once made by a holder of public stock, may be withdrawn at any time, with BowX’s consent, up to the time the
vote is taken with respect to the BCA Proposal at the special meeting. If you deliver your shares for redemption to Continental and later decide prior to the special meeting not to elect redemption, you may request that BowX’s transfer agent
return the shares (physically or electronically) to you. You may make such request by contacting Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, at the phone number or address listed at the end of this section. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, prior to the vote
taken on the BCA Proposal at the special meeting. No request for redemption will be honored unless the holder’s public stock have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to Continental, at least two business days prior to the vote
at the special meeting. If a holder of public stock properly makes a request for redemption and the public stock are delivered as
described above, then, if the Business Combination is consummated, New WeWork will redeem the public stock for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business
Combination. The redemption will take place following the Business Combination and, accordingly, it is shares of New WeWork Common Stock that will be redeemed. If you are a holder of public stock and you exercise your redemption rights, such exercise will not result in the loss of any warrants that you
may hold. xxv Table of Contents Q: Is there a limit on the number of shares I may redeem? A: A public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such public stockholder or any other person with whom such
public stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its public stock with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the public stock,
without the consent of BowX. Accordingly, if a public stockholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the public stock, then any such stock in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for cash, except
with BowX’s consent. Q: Must I vote “No” in order to redeem my shares? A: No. You may exercise your redemption rights whether you vote your public stock for or against the BCA
Proposal or do not vote your shares. As a result, the BCA Proposal can be approved by stockholders who will redeem their public stock and no longer remain stockholders, leaving stockholders who choose not to redeem their public stock holding shares
in a company with a less liquid trading market, fewer stockholders, less cash and the potential inability to meet stock exchange listing standards. Q: If I am a holder of units, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my units? A: No. Holders of issued and outstanding units must elect to separate the units into the underlying public stock
and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public stock. If you hold your units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must notify your broker or bank that you elect to separate the units into the
underlying public stock and public warrants, or if you hold units registered in your own name, you must contact Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, directly and instruct them to do so. You are requested to cause your public stock to be
separated and delivered to Continental by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on             , 2021, (two business days before the special meeting) in order to exercise your redemption rights with
respect to your public stock. Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising my redemption rights? A: BowX stockholders who exercise their redemption rights to receive cash from the trust account in exchange for
their public stock generally (subject to specified exceptions) will be required to treat the transaction either as (1) a sale of such shares, in which case the redeeming stockholder would recognize gain or loss upon the redemption in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax basis of the public stock redeemed, or (2) a distribution in respect of such shares. If the redemption is treated as a sale of shares, the stockholder’s gain
or loss should be treated as capital gain or loss if such shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the redemption. A stockholder’s tax basis in his, her or its public stock generally will equal the cost of such shares. If the
redemption is treated as a distribution in respect of the stockholder’s public stock, the character of the stockholder’s income will depend on whether BowX has current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. A stockholder who purchased BowX Units will have to allocate the cost between the shares of BowX Class A Common Stock or warrants comprising the BowX Units based on their relative fair market values at the time of the
purchase. See the section entitled “ Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights .” Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers to WeWork Stockholders? A: For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together, are intended to constitute a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code, and each of BowX and WeWork expects to receive a tax opinion from its counsel, Cooley LLP (“Cooley”) and Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), respectively, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Mergers will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions of counsel
will be based on customary assumptions, representations, covenants, and undertakings of WeWork, BowX, Merger Sub, and Merger Sub II. If any of the assumptions, representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or is
breached, the validity of the opinions may be affected and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Mergers could differ materially from those described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The obligation of each of WeWork and xxvi Table of Contents BowX to consummate the Mergers, however, is not conditioned upon the receipt of such opinions of Cooley, Skadden, or any other counsel, nor will the parties request a ruling from the IRS
regarding the qualification of the Mergers as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that the Mergers qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code: (i) U.S. holders (as defined
herein) of WeWork Capital Stock will generally not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) under FIRPTA, Non-U.S. holders (as defined herein) of WeWork Capital Stock will generally recognize gain (but not loss) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Furthermore, certain Non-U.S. holders will be subject to withholding of U.S. tax under FIRPTA in an amount equal to 15% of the amount realized on the exchange of their WeWork Capital Stock in the Mergers. The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of WeWork Capital Stock. You should
read the section entitled “ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers for WeWork Stockholders ” for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Mergers. Tax matters can be
complicated and the tax consequences of the Mergers to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the Mergers to you. Q: What happens to the funds deposited in the trust account after consummation of the Business Combination? A: Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the funds deposited in the trust account will be released to pay
holders of public stock who properly exercise their redemption rights; to pay transaction fees and expenses incurred by BowX and WeWork in connection with the Business Combination; and for working capital and general corporate purposes of New WeWork
following the Business Combination. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Sources and Uses of Funds for the Business Combination .” Q: What happens if a substantial number of the public stockholders vote in favor of the BCA Proposal and
exercise their redemption rights? A: Our public stockholders are not required to vote in favor of the Business Combination in order to exercise
their redemption rights. Accordingly, the Business Combination may be consummated even though the funds available from the trust account and the number of public stockholders are reduced as a result of redemptions by public stockholders. As a result
of redemptions, holders of New WeWork Common Stock may be left holding shares in a company with a less liquid trading market, fewer stockholders, less cash and the potential inability to meet stock exchange listing standards. The Merger Agreement provides that the obligations of WeWork to consummate the First Merger are conditioned on, among other things, that as of
the Closing, the Trust Amount plus the PIPE Investment is at least equal to the Minimum Available Cash Condition amount. If such conditions are not met, and such conditions are not or cannot be waived under the terms of the Merger Agreement, then
the Merger Agreement could terminate and the proposed Business Combination may not be consummated. In addition, in no event will we redeem public stock in an amount that would cause New WeWork’s net tangible assets (as determined in accordance
with Rule 3a51-1 (g)(1) of the Exchange Act) to be less than $5,000,001. Q: What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Business Combination? A: There are a number of closing conditions in the Merger Agreement, including that BowX’s stockholders have
approved and adopted the Merger Agreement. For more information about conditions to the consummation of the Business
Combination, see the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement .” Q: When do you expect the Business Combination to be completed? A: It is currently anticipated that the Business Combination will be consummated promptly following the special
meeting of stockholders; provided that all other conditions to the consummation of the Business Combination have been satisfied or waived. For a description of the conditions for the completion of the Business Combination, see the section entitled
“ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement .” xxvii Table of Contents Q: What happens if the Business Combination is not consummated? A: There are certain circumstances under which the Merger Agreement may be terminated. See the sections entitled
“ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement — Closing Conditions ” and “ — Termination; Effectiveness ” for information regarding the parties’ specific termination rights. If BowX is not able to complete the Business Combination with WeWork by August 7, 2022, and is not able to complete
another business combination by such date, in each case, as such date may be extended pursuant to the Organizational Documents, BowX will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible, but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public stock, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
(less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding shares of public stock, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the
right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) to our obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. See the sections entitled “ Risk Factors — Risks
Related to the Business Combination and BowX — BowX may not be able to complete an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case it would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up and it would redeem the public stock and liquidate, in which case the public stockholders may only receive $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and the public warrants will expire worthless ” and
“ — BowX stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against BowX to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. ” Our initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and our
directors and officers have waived any right to any liquidation distribution with respect to the Founder Shares. In the event of
liquidation, there will be no distribution with respect to outstanding warrants. Accordingly, the warrants will expire worthless. Q: If I hold warrants, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my warrants? A: No. There are no redemption rights with respect to the warrants. Q: Do I have appraisal rights in connection with the proposed Business Combination? A: No. Neither BowX’s stockholders nor BowX’s warrant holders have appraisal rights in connection with
the Business Combination. Q: What do I need to do now? A: BowX urges you to read this proxy statement/prospectus, including the financial statements, Annexes and the
documents referred to herein, carefully and in their entirety and to consider how the Business Combination will affect you as a stockholder or warrant holder. BowX’s stockholders should then vote as soon as possible in accordance with the
instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus and on the enclosed proxy card or, if you hold your shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, on the voting instruction form provided by the broker, bank or nominee. Q: How do I vote? A: If you are a holder of record of BowX Common Stock on the record date for the special meeting, you may vote
virtually at the special meeting or by submitting a proxy for the special meeting. You may submit your proxy by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed xxviii Table of Contents postage-paid envelope. If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or nominee
to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank or nominee with instructions on how to vote your stock or, if you wish to attend the special meeting and vote
while attending virtually, obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or nominee. Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote at the special meeting? A: At the special meeting of stockholders, BowX will count a properly executed proxy marked “ABSTAIN”
with respect to a particular proposal as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. For purposes of approval, an abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against each of the Business Combination
Proposal, the Organizational Documents Proposals and the Adjournment Proposal, and will have no effect on any of the other proposals. Q: What will happen if I sign, date and return my proxy card without indicating how I wish to vote? A: Signed and dated proxies received by BowX without an indication of how the stockholder intends to vote on a
proposal will be voted in favor of each proposal presented to the stockholders. Q: How can I attend the special meeting? A: You may attend the special meeting and vote your shares virtually during the special meeting via live webcast
by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/bowxacquisitioncorp/sm2021. As a registered stockholder, you received a proxy card from Continental, which contains instructions on how to attend the special meeting virtually, including the URL address, along

proxy@continentalstock.com. Please note that you will not be able to physically attend the special meeting in person, but may attend the special meeting virtually by following the instructions below. You can pre-register to attend the special meeting virtually
starting             , 2021. Enter the URL address into your browser, and enter your 12-digit meeting control number, name and email address.
Once you pre-register you can vote or enter questions in the chat box. Prior to or at the start of the special meeting you will need to re-log in using your 12-digit meeting control number and will also be prompted to enter your 12-digit meeting control number if you vote virtually during the special meeting. BowX
recommends that you log in at least 15 minutes before the special meeting to ensure you are logged in when the special meeting starts. If
your shares are held in “street name,” you may attend the special meeting. You will need to contact Continental at the number or email address above, to receive a 12-digit meeting control number

only to the special meeting by dialing 1 877-770-3647 (toll-free) if within the U.S. or Canada, or +1 312-780-0854 (standard rates apply) if outside of the U.S. and Canada, when prompted enter the pin 14309853#. This is listen only, you will not be able to vote or enter
questions during the special meeting. Q: Do I need to attend the special meeting of stockholders virtually to vote my shares? A: No. You are invited to attend the special meeting virtually to vote on the proposals described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. However, you do not need to attend the special meeting of stockholders virtually to xxix Table of Contents vote your shares. Instead, you may submit your proxy by signing, dating and returning the applicable enclosed proxy card(s) in the pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. Your vote is important. BowX encourages you to vote as soon as possible after carefully reading this proxy statement/prospectus. Q: If I am not going to attend the special meeting of stockholders virtually, should I return my proxy card
instead? A: Yes. After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus,
please submit your proxy, as applicable, by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Q: If my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or nominee automatically vote my
shares for me? A: No. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the
“beneficial holder” of the stock held for you in what is known as “street name.” If this is the case, this proxy statement/prospectus may have been forwarded to you by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, or its agent, and
you may need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or nominee as to how to vote your shares. Under the rules of various
national and regional securities exchanges, your broker, bank, or nominee cannot vote your shares with respect to non-discretionary matters unless you provide instructions on how to vote in accordance with the
information and procedures provided to you by your broker, bank, or nominee. We believe all the proposals presented to the stockholders will be considered non-discretionary and therefore your broker, bank, or
nominee cannot vote your shares without your instruction. Your bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. As the beneficial holder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other
nominee as to how to vote your shares and you should instruct your broker to vote your shares in accordance with directions you provide. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker on a proposal on which your broker does not have
discretionary authority to vote, your shares will not be voted on that proposal. This is called a “broker non-vote.” Any broker non-votes, while considered
present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the special meeting on any proposal, and will have the same effect as a vote against the Organizational Documents Proposal and will have no effect on any of the other
proposals. Q: What is the quorum requirement for the special meeting of stockholders? A: A quorum will be present at the special meeting of stockholders if a majority of the BowX Common Stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting is attending virtually or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the meeting has the power to adjourn the special meeting. As of the record date for the special meeting, 30,187,501 shares of BowX Common Stock would be required to achieve a quorum. If there is no quorum, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the special meeting to another date. Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting? A: BowX stockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if they owned BowX
Common Stock at the close of business on             , 2021, which is the “record date” for the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote for each share of BowX Common
Stock owned at the close of business on the record date. If your stock is held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related to the stock you beneficially own are
properly counted. Warrants do not have voting rights. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 48,300,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding. xxx Table of Contents Q: How many votes do I have? A: BowX stockholders are entitled to one vote at the special meeting for each share of BowX Common Stock held of
record as of the record date. As of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, there were 48,300,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding. Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the special meeting? A: The following votes are required for each proposal at the special meeting: (i) BCA Proposal: The approval of the BCA Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. (ii) Organizational Documents Proposals: The separate approval of each of the Organizational Documents
Proposals (other than Organizational Documents Proposals A and D) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock. The approval of Organizational Documents Proposals A and D will require the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of BowX Class A Common Stock on the record date and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock on the record date. (iii) Director Election Proposal: The approval of the Director Election Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a plurality of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and who vote thereon at the special meeting. Because the Director Election Proposal is an uncontested election with no cumulative voting,
every director nominee will be assured election upon receiving just one “for” vote. (iv) Stock Issuance Proposal: The approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at the special meeting. (v) Equity Incentive Plan Proposal : The approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. (vi) ESPP Proposal : The approval of the ESPP Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. (vii) Adjournment Proposal: The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. Q: What are the recommendations of BowX’s board of directors? A: BowX’s board of directors believes that the BCA Proposal and the other proposals to be presented at the
special meeting are in the best interest of BowX’s stockholders and unanimously recommends that its stockholders vote “FOR” the BCA Proposal, “FOR” each of the separate Organizational Documents Proposals, “FOR” the
Director Election Proposal, “FOR” the Stock Issuance Proposal, “FOR” the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal, “FOR” the ESPP Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, in each case, if presented to the special
meeting. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of BowX’s directors may result in a
conflict of interest on the part of such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to
recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. In addition, BowX’s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Interests
of BowX ’ s Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination ” for a further discussion of these considerations. xxxi Table of Contents Q: What interests do BowX’s current officers and directors have in the Business Combination? A: BowX’s board of directors and executive officers may have interests in the Business Combination that are
different from, in addition to or in conflict with, yours. These interests include: • the beneficial ownership of our initial stockholders of an aggregate of 12,075,000 shares of BowX
Class B Common Stock and 7,773,333 private placement warrants, which shares and warrants would become worthless if BowX does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as our initial stockholders have waived any
redemption right with respect to these shares. Our initial stockholders paid an aggregate of $25,000 for the BowX Class B Common Stock, and $11,660,000 for the private placement warrants, and such shares and warrants have an aggregate market
value of approximately $             million and $             million, respectively, based on the closing price of BowX
Class A Common Stock of $             on Nasdaq on             , 2021, the record date for the special meeting of
stockholders. Each of our officers and directors is a member of the Sponsor. Vivek Ranadivé and Murray Rode are the managing members of the Sponsor, and as such Mr. Ranadivé and Rode have voting and investment discretion with
respect to the BowX Common Stock and warrants held of record by the Sponsor; • the anticipated continuation of Mr. Ranadivé as a director of New WeWork; • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to redeem any of their shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve the Business Combination; • the fact that our initial stockholders, including our Sponsor, and our directors and officers, paid an aggregate
of approximately $11,660,000 for their 7,773,333 private placement warrants to purchase shares of BowX Class A Common Stock and that such private placement warrants will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated by
August 7, 2022; • the fact that our initial stockholders, including our Sponsor and its affiliates, who purchased Class B Common
Stock and private placement warrants at the time of our IPO may experience a positive rate of return on their investment, even if our public shareholders experience a negative rate of return on their investment; • that, at the Closing, we will enter into the Registration Rights Agreement, which provides for registration
rights to the initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and BowX’s directors and officers and their permitted transferees; • the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of BowX and the continuation of directors’
and officers’ liability insurance after the Business Combination; • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, though there
have been no material out-of-pocket expenses subject to reimbursement and BowX does not anticipate any such expenses prior to Closing; and • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business
combination is not completed. These interests may influence BowX’s directors in making their recommendation that
you vote in favor of the approval of the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby. BowX’s directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Business Combination, and in
recommending to BowX stockholders that they approve the Business Combination. BowX stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Business Combination. Q: How does the Sponsor intend to vote their shares? A: Our initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and our directors and officers have agreed to vote any shares
of BowX Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Business Combination, including their shares of BowX Class B Common Stock and any public stock purchased after our initial public offering (including in xxxii Table of Contents open market and privately negotiated transactions). As of the record date, our initial stockholders, including our Sponsor, and our directors and officers beneficially own an aggregate of
approximately 18.6% of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock. Q: What happens if I sell my BowX Common Stock before the special meeting? A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and earlier than the
date that the Business Combination is expected to be completed. If you transfer your public stock after the applicable record date, but before the special meeting, unless you grant a proxy to the transferee, you will retain your right to vote at

Merger Agreement This subsection of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement,
but does not purport to describe all of the terms of the Merger Agreement. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety because it is the primary legal document that governs the Business Combination. Structure of the Mergers On March 25, 2021, BowX entered into the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and WeWork, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub
will merge with and into WeWork, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and WeWork will be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of BowX (the “First Merger”). Pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of a separate agreement and plan of merger to be entered into by BowX, the surviving corporation of the First Merger and Merger Sub II, as soon as practicable following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First
Merger, the surviving corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of such merger (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”). In connection
with the Mergers, BowX will change its name to WeWork Inc. (“New WeWork”). Closing and Effective Time In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, the closing of the First Merger (the “Closing”)
will take place on the date which is two (2) business days after the first date on which all conditions set forth in Article IX of the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction and waiver thereof) or such other time and place as BowX and WeWork may mutually agree to in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in the Merger Agreement
as the “Closing Date.” The date and time the First Merger becomes effective is referred to as the “Effective Time.” Aggregate Merger Consideration As a result of and upon the Closing, among other things, each outstanding share of WeWork Capital Stock (as defined herein) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as defined herein) (other than the Excluded Shares) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a number of shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock (as defined herein) determined by multiplying the number of
shares of WeWork Capital Stock held by a holder at the Effective Time by an exchange ratio determined by dividing the total number of shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock being issued in the First Merger (655,300,000) (the “Aggregate
Merger 2 Table of Contents Consideration”) by the Aggregate Fully Diluted WeWork Capital Stock (as defined herein). The shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock being issued in the First Merger have a deemed value of
$10.00 per share, which represents a pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion. For further details, see the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — The Merger Agreement — Consideration and Conversion of
Certain WeWork Securities — Aggregate Merger Consideration .” Representations and Warranties The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of BowX, Merger Sub and WeWork, certain of which are qualified by materiality and

information, see the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Related Agreements .” WeWork Stockholder Support
Agreements On March 25, 2021, BowX entered into Stockholder Support Agreements (the “Stockholder Support
Agreements”), by and among BowX, WeWork and certain stockholders of WeWork (the “Key Stockholders”). Pursuant to the Stockholder Support Agreements, the Key Stockholders agreed to, among other things, execute and deliver a written
consent with respect to the outstanding shares of WeWork Capital Stock held by the Key Stockholders adopting the Merger Agreement and related transactions and approving the Business Combination (including consenting to enter into the Merger
Agreement effective on March 25, 2021, for purposes of the Related Party Charter Provision, to the extent applicable. Such written consent must be delivered promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours (or, in the case of SBWW,
WeWork’s largest stockholder, five (5) calendar days) after (x) the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the approval by BowX stockholders of the Business Combination is declared effective by the SEC and delivered or otherwise made
available to BowX and WeWork stockholders, and (y) BowX or WeWork requests it. The shares of WeWork Common Stock and WeWork Preferred Stock that are owned by the Key Stockholders and subject to the Stockholder Support Agreements represent a
majority of the outstanding voting power of WeWork Capital Stock (voting as a single class and on an as converted basis). The execution and delivery of such written consents by all of the stockholders of WeWork that have entered into Stockholder
Support Agreements will constitute the WeWork stockholder approval at the time of such delivery, and no additional approval or vote from any holders of any class or series of stock of WeWork will be necessary to adopt and approve the Merger
Agreement and the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Stockholder Support Agreement with SBWW, any proposed amendment of the Merger Agreement, or waiver by WeWork of the provisions therein, requires the prior written consent of SBWW, and at such
time that the Merger Agreement is amended, or any provisions therein are waived by WeWork, without the consent of SBWW, the obligations of SBWW under such Stockholder Support Agreement, including obligations to approve and adopt the Mergers,
expires. This consent right of SBWW continues even after it has fulfilled its obligations under the Stockholder Support Agreement. Sponsor Support Agreement On March 25, 2021, BowX entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”), by and among Sponsor, WeWork

each case, subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Support Agreement. Registration Rights Agreement The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, BowX, Anchor PIPE Investors, the Sponsor and certain WeWork Stockholders
will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which BowX will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, certain shares of
BowX Common Stock and other equity securities of BowX that are held by the parties thereto from time to time. In certain circumstances, various parties in the Registration Rights Agreement can collectively demand up to nine underwritten offerings in
any twelve-month period, collectively demand no less than six underwritten block trade offerings in any twelve-month period, and will be entitled to piggyback registration rights, in each case subject to certain limitations set forth in the
Registration Rights Agreement. 5 Table of Contents PIPE Subscription Agreements On March 25, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BowX entered into subscription agreements (the
“Subscription Agreements”) with certain existing stockholders of WeWork (the “Anchor PIPE Investors”) and the Third-Party PIPE Investors, pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors
have collectively subscribed for 80,000,000 shares (the “PIPE Shares”) of the New WeWork Common Stock for $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price equal to $800,000,000 (the “PIPE Investment”). The PIPE Investment will be
consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing. The Subscription Agreements for the PIPE Investors (other than the Anchor PIPE
Investors, whose registration rights are governed by the Registration Rights Agreement) provide for certain registration rights. In particular, BowX is required to, as soon as practicable but no later than 30 calendar days following the Closing,
file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of such shares. Additionally, BowX is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing
thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 60th calendar day (or 90th calendar day if the SEC notifies BowX that it will “review” the registration statement) following the filing date thereof or (ii) the 10th business day
after the date BowX is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review. BowX must use commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the registration statement effective until the earliest of: (i) the date the PIPE Investors no longer hold any registrable shares, (ii) the date all registrable shares held by the PIPE Investors may be sold without restriction under Rule
144 under the Securities Act, and without the requirement for BowX to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144(c)(1) or Rule 144(i)(2), as applicable, and (iii) three years from the date of effectiveness of
the registration statement. The Subscription Agreements include a condition that (a) there shall have been no modifications,
amendments or waivers to (or consents in respect of) the Merger Agreement that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the economic benefits that the PIPE Investor would reasonably expect to receive under the Subscription Agreement,
unless the PIPE Investor has consented to such amendment, (b) there shall have been no amendment, modification or waiver of any other Subscription Agreement that materially benefits the other PIPE Investors thereunder unless such PIPE Investor
has been offered substantially the same benefits and (c) with respect to the Anchor PIPE Investors, there shall be no amendment, waiver or modification to the investment of the Anchor PIPE Investors. The Subscription Agreements will terminate with no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of: (a) such date and time as the
Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties to such Subscription Agreement; (c) if any of the conditions to closing set forth in such Subscription Agreement are not satisfied
on or prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement fail to occur; or (d) the Agreement End Date. BowX is relying on the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the issuance of the PIPE Shares to the PIPE Investors in
the PIPE Investment. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, each PIPE Investor represented and warranted that it is either a “qualified institutional buyer” or an “accredited investor” as defined in the applicable SEC
regulations. Lock-Up Agreement In connection with the Business Combination, the Sponsor, certain of BowX’s officers and certain of WeWork’s officers and
stockholders entered into the Lock-Up Agreements pursuant to which they agreed not to (a) sell or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of New WeWork
Common Stock held by such persons immediately after the Closing (the “Lock-Up Shares”), (b) enter into any 6 Table of Contents swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such Lock-Up Shares, or
(c) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b), for the duration of the applicable Lock-Up Period. For additional information, see the section entitled
“ BCA Proposal—Related Agreements—Lock-Up Agreement. ” Credit
Support Letter On March 25, 2021, WeWork Companies LLC, the SoftBank Obligor, and BowX entered into the Credit Support Letter

LLC and purchased by the Note Purchaser (the “Amended Senior Secured Notes”). The Amended Senior Secured Notes will be documented in an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the “A&R NPA”) by and among WeWork
Companies LLC, WW Co-Obligor Inc. and the Note Purchaser. The parties will enter into the A&R NPA upon the earlier to occur of (a) the date of the Closing and (b) August 12, 2021. The
Amended Senior Secured Notes will mature on the earlier to occur of: (a) 18 months from the date of the Closing; or (b) February 12, 2023. Stockholders Agreement The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, BowX, the Sponsor, SBWW, SVFE and certain other holders of BowX Common Stock will enter
into a Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement,” the form of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G), pursuant to which, so long as such holders of BowX Common Stock continue to hold a specified amount
of BowX Common Stock, then such holder will have the right to designate for nomination by the board of directors the number of candidates for election to the board of directors specified in the Stockholders Agreement. For additional information, see
the section entitled “ BCA Proposal—Related Agreements— Stockholders Agreement. ” Warrants Concurrently with and contingent upon the Closing, BowX will issue to SBWW or its designees the First Warrant to purchase a number
of shares of BowX Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to 47,366,404 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms set forth therein, at a price per share equal to $0.01 divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the
nearest full cent). The First Warrant will expire on the tenth anniversary of the Closing. Although the First Warrant will be issued by BowX, solely for purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio used in the Business Combination, the First Warrant
is treated in the same manner as a hypothetical outstanding warrant to purchase 47,366,404 shares of WeWork Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The First Warrant issued to SBWW is an inducement to obtain SBWW’s, and its affiliates’, support in effectuating the automatic
conversion of WeWork Preferred Stock on a one-to-one basis to WeWork Common Stock. At the Exchange Ratio, the First Warrant will enable SBWW to purchase 39,115,176 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock. Assuming a price of $10 per
share, the First Warrant will have an estimated 7 Table of Contents fair value of approximately $391.2 million. A copy of the form of First Warrant is attached as Exhibit 10.19 to this proxy statement/prospectus. Additionally, concurrently with and contingent upon the LC Facility Termination Extension, BowX will issue to the SoftBank Obligor or its
designees the LC Warrant to purchase a number of shares of BowX Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to 14,431,991 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, subject to the terms set forth therein, at a price per share equal to $0.01
divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest full cent). The LC Warrant would expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance. The LC Warrant issued to Softbank Obligor as consideration for the Softbank Obligor agreeing to continue to act as co-obligor under
WeWork’s existing LC Facility for the extension period of one year. At the Exchange Ratio, the LC Warrant will enable Softbank Obligor to purchase 11,917,938 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock. Assuming a price of $10 per
share, the LC Warrant will have an estimated fair value of approximately $119.2 million. The Company will record the estimated fair value of the LC Warrant as a deferred asset (guarantee premium), which will be amortized to interest expense
over the amended term of the letter of credit facility, in a comparable fashion to a commitment or access fee paid to obtain a revolving credit arrangement. A copy of the form of LC Warrant is attached as Exhibit 10.20 to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Ownership of New WeWork following the Business Combination As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, there are 48,300,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding, and
12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, there is outstanding an aggregate of 23,873,333 warrants, which includes the 7,773,333 private placement warrants and the
16,100,000 public warrants. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of BowX Class A Common Stock and, following the Business Combination, will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of New WeWork Common
Stock. It is anticipated that, based on the assumptions set forth below, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the ownership
of New WeWork will be as follows: Share Ownership in New WeWork (1) No Additional Redemptions Assuming Maximum Redemption Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares WeWork Stockholders 655,300,000 82.7 % 655,300,000 87.4 % Initial Stockholders 9,075,000 1.1 % 9,075,000 1.2 % BowX’s Public Stockholders (excluding PIPE Shares) 48,300,000 6.1 % 5,068,902 0.7 % PIPE Investors 80,000,000 10.1 % 80,000,000 10.7 % Total 792,675,000 100 % 749,443,902 100 % (1) The figures in this table are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the scenarios described
below, which may be different from the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but the number of shares
redeemed is less than 43,231,098, the ownership percentages set forth above will fall in between the two scenarios. For example, if we assume that the number of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock redeemed in connection with the Business Combination
total 21,615,549, BowX public stockholders will hold a total of 26,684,451 shares of New WeWork Common Stock at Closing, representing a 3.5% ownership interest. The numbers of shares of “New WeWork Common Stock Assuming No Redemption” set forth above assumes that no public stockholders elect
to have their public stock redeemed, and the numbers of shares of 8 Table of Contents “New WeWork Common Stock Assuming Maximum Redemption” set forth above assumes that 43,231,098 shares of public stock are redeemed. These numbers and percentages assume (i) (a) the vesting of all shares of New WeWork Common Stock received in respect of the New WeWork
Restricted Stock Awards, (b) the vesting and exercise of all in-the-money New WeWork Options for shares of New WeWork Common Stock, (c) the vesting of all New WeWork Restricted Stock Units and the issuance of shares of New WeWork Common Stock in
respect thereof, (d) the vesting and net exercise of all in-the-money warrants, and (e) that New WeWork issues shares of New WeWork Common Stock as the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which in the aggregate equals
655,300,000 shares of New WeWork Common Stock (assuming that all New WeWork Options are net-settled) and (ii) that New WeWork issues 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the PIPE Investment. Shares
of New WeWork Class A Common Stock underlying or exchangeable for out-of-the-money stock options and warrants are not included in these numbers and percentages (or in the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration). These numbers and
percentages do not include both the number of shares of New WeWork Class C Common Stock and the number of related shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock. In addition, the numbers of shares and percentage interests set forth above do not take into
account certain potential future exercises of warrants or grants or issuances pursuant to the equity incentive plan established to be effective after the Closing, or any other equity issuances of New WeWork. See the section entitled “Risk
Factors – Public stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of New WeWork Common Stock as consideration in the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment and due to future issuances pursuant to the 2021
Plan, the First Warrant, the LC Warrant and the exercise of public warrants and private warrants. Having a minority stock ownership position may reduce the influence that BowX’s current stockholders have on the management of New
WeWork.” See the section entitled “Description of BowX Securities – Redeemable Warrants.” If the
actual facts are different from these assumptions, the percentage ownership retained by the Company’s existing stockholders in the combined company will be different. For example, if we assume that all of the 16,100,000 public warrants and
7,773,333 private placement warrants that will remain outstanding post-Business Combination were exercisable and exercised following completion of the Business Combination in accordance with their terms, then the anticipated ownership of New WeWork
at the Closing would be as follows: Share Ownership in New WeWork (1) No Additional Redemptions Assuming Maximum Redemption Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares Number of Shares Percentage of Outstanding Shares WeWork Stockholders 655,300,000 80.3 % 655,300,000 84.7 % Initial Stockholders 16,848,333 2.1 % 16,848,333 2.2 % BowX’s Public Stockholders (excluding PIPE Shares) 64,400,000 7.9 % 21,168,902 2.7 % PIPE Investors 80,000,000 9.8 % 80,000,000 10.3 % Total 816,548,333 100 % 773,317,235 100 % (1) The figures in this table are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the scenarios described
below, which may be different from the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but the number of shares
redeemed is less than 43,231,098, the ownership percentages set forth above will fall in between the two scenarios. For example, if we assume that the number of shares of BowX Class A Common Stock redeemed in connection with the Business Combination
total 21,615,549, BowX public stockholders will hold a total of 42,784,451 shares of New WeWork Common Stock at Closing, representing a 5.4% ownership interest. Proposals to be Put to the Stockholders of BowX at the Special Meeting At the special meeting, the BowX stockholders will be asked to separately approve the following proposals: • The BCA Proposal—a proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination; 9 Table of Contents • The Organizational Documents Proposals – four proposals to amend BowX’s Existing Charter: • Organizational Documents Proposal A — to authorize the change in the authorized capital stock of BowX
from 87,500,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “BowX Class A Common Stock”), 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.0001, to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of New WeWork (the “New WeWork Class A Common Stock”), 25,041,666 shares of Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share,
of New WeWork (the “New WeWork Class C Common Stock” and, together with the WeWork Class A Common Stock, the “New WeWork Common Stock”), and (c) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 per share, of New WeWork
(the “New WeWork Preferred Stock” and, together with the New WeWork Common Stock, the “New WeWork Capital Stock”). Further, to authorize the New WeWork Class C Common Stock as a non-economic voting security without rights to dividends or on liquidation; • Organizational Documents Proposal B — with respect to any vote or election submitted to the holders of
shares of New WeWork Capital Stock for approval, to restrict the SoftBank Holders (as defined herein), for a period of at least two years, from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present (in person or by proxy)
and voting at any such meeting of the stockholders; • Organizational Documents Proposal C — to provide for only one class of board of directors and direct that
board vacancies be filled by the majority of directors then in office, unless specified otherwise in the Stockholders Agreement (as defined below); and • Organizational Documents Proposal D — to approve and adopt the additional changes in the Proposed Charter,
including changing BowX’s name from “BowX Acquisition Corp.” to “WeWork Inc.,” which our board of directors believes are necessary to adequately address the needs of New WeWork immediately following the consummation of the
Business Combination and approval of the Proposed Charter; • The Director Election Proposal — a proposal to approve the election of nine directors, who, upon
consummation of the Business Combination, will be the directors of New WeWork; • The Stock Issuance Proposal — a proposal to approve, for purposes of complying with applicable listing rules
of Nasdaq, the issuance of (a) shares of BowX Class A Common Stock to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the PIPE Investment and (b) shares of New WeWork Common Stock to the WeWork Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement; • The Equity Incentive Plan Proposal — a proposal to approve and adopt the 2021 Plan; • The ESPP Proposal — a proposal to approve and adopt the ESPP; and • The Adjournment Proposal—a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or
dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for the approval of one or more proposals at the special meeting. If BowX’s stockholders do not approve each of the Condition Precedent Proposals, then unless certain conditions in the Merger Agreement are waived by the
applicable parties to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement could terminate and the Business Combination may not be consummated. The applicable parties to the Merger Agreement would not be able to waive Organizational Documents Proposals A
or D and still complete the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement because there will not be a sufficient number of authorized shares of capital stock of BowX to issue the shares required to be issued in the Merger if
Organizational Documents Proposal A is not approved. See the sections entitled “ BCA Proposal ,” “ Organizational Documents Proposals ,” “ Director Election Proposal ,” “ Stock Issuance
Proposal ,” “ Equity Incentive Plan Proposal ,” “ ESPP Proposal ” and “ Adjournment Proposal. ” 10 Table of Contents Date, Time and Place of Special Meeting of BowX’s Stockholders The special meeting of the stockholders of BowX will be held
at                , Eastern Time, on                , 2021, virtually via live webcast at
https://www.cstproxy.com/bowxacquisitioncorp/sm2021, to consider and vote upon the proposals to be put to the special meeting, including if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the
tabulated vote at the time of the special meeting, each of the Condition Precedent Proposals have not been approved. Voting Power; Record Date BowX stockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting if they owned BowX Common Stock at the
close of business on                 , 2021, which is the “record date” for the special meeting. Stockholders will have one vote for each share of BowX Common
Stock owned at the close of business on the record date. If your stock is held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related to the stock you beneficially own are
properly counted. Warrants do not have voting rights. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 48,300,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding. Quorum and Vote of BowX Stockholders A quorum of BowX stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the BowX special meeting if a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting are attending virtually or by proxy. As of the record date for the special meeting, 30,187,501 shares of BowX Common Stock would be required to achieve a
quorum. The Sponsor has agreed to vote all of its BowX Common Stock in favor of the proposals being presented at the special meeting. As of the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus, the initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and the directors and officers own approximately 18.6% of the issued and outstanding BowX Common Stock. The proposals presented at the special meeting require the following votes: (i) BCA Proposal: The approval of the BCA Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. (ii) Organizational Documents Proposals: The separate approval of each of the Organizational Documents
Proposals (other than Organizational Documents Proposals A and D) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock. The approval of Organizational Documents Proposals A and D will require the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of BowX Class A Common Stock on the record date and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock on the record date. (iii) Director Election Proposal: The approval of the Director Election Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the plurality of the outstanding shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and who vote thereon at the special meeting. Because the Director Election Proposal is an uncontested election with no cumulative
voting, every director nominee will be assured election upon receiving just one “for” vote. (iv) Stock Issuance Proposal: The approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. (v) Equity Incentive Plan Proposal: The approval of the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. 11 Table of Contents (vi) ESPP Proposal: The approval of the ESPP Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote and who vote thereon at the special meeting. (vii) Adjournment Proposal: The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of BowX Common Stock attending virtually or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the special meeting. Redemption Rights Pursuant to the
Organizational Documents, a public stockholder may request of BowX that BowX redeem all or a portion of its public stock for cash if the Business Combination is consummated. As a holder of public stock, you will be entitled to receive cash for any
public stock to be redeemed only if you: • (a) hold public stock or (b) if you hold public stock through units, you elect to separate your units into
the underlying public stock and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public stock; • submit a written request to Continental, that BowX redeem all or a portion of your public stock for cash; and • deliver your public stock to Continental physically or electronically through DTC. Holders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their public stock in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,
on                , 2021, (two business days before the special meeting) in order for their stock to be redeemed. BowX requests that any request for redemption include
the identity as to the beneficial owner making such request. Electronic delivery of your stock generally will be faster than delivery of physical stock certificates. Holders of units must elect to separate the units into the underlying public stock and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights
with respect to the public stock. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public stock and public warrants, or if a
holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact Continental directly and instruct them to do so. Public
stockholders will be entitled to request that their public stock be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us (net of taxes payable). For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the trust account as of June 30, 2021, of approximately $483.1 million, the
estimated per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.00. However, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of BowX’s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the
public stockholders, regardless of whether such public stockholder votes or, if they do vote, irrespective of if they vote for or against the BCA Proposal. Therefore, the per share distribution from the trust account in such a situation may be less
than originally expected due to such claims. Whether you vote, and if you do vote irrespective of how you vote, on any proposal, including the BCA Proposal, will have no impact on the amount you will receive upon exercise of your redemption rights.
It is expected that the funds to be distributed to public stockholders electing to redeem their public stock will be distributed promptly after the consummation of the Business Combination. Any request for redemption, once made by a holder of public stock, may be withdrawn at any time, with BowX’s consent, up to the time the
vote is taken with respect to the BCA Proposal at the special meeting. If you deliver your shares for redemption to Continental and later decide prior to the special meeting not to elect redemption, you may request that BowX’s transfer agent
return the shares (physically or electronically) to you. You may make such request by contacting Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, at the phone number or address listed at the end of this section. Any corrected or changed written exercise of redemption rights must be received by Continental, BowX’s transfer agent, prior to the vote
taken on the BCA Proposal at the special meeting. No request for redemption will 12 Table of Contents be honored unless the holder’s public stock have been delivered (either physically or electronically) to Continental, at least two business days prior to the vote at the special meeting. If a holder of public stock properly makes a request for redemption and the public stock are delivered as described above, then, if the
Business Combination is consummated, New WeWork will redeem the public stock for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. The redemption
will take place following the Business Combination and, accordingly, it is shares of New WeWork Common Stock that will be redeemed. If
you are a holder of public stock and you exercise your redemption rights, such exercise will not result in the loss of any warrants that you may hold. Holders of the warrants will not have redemption rights with respect to the warrants. Appraisal Rights Neither BowX
stockholders nor Warrant holders have appraisal rights in connection with the Business Combination. Proxy Solicitation Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone or in person. BowX has engaged Morrow to assist in the solicitation of proxies. If a stockholder grants a proxy, it may still vote its stock at the meeting if it revokes its proxy before the special meeting. A stockholder
also may change its vote by submitting a later-dated proxy as described in the section entitled “ Special Meeting of BowX — Revoking Your Proxy .” Interests of BowX’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination When you consider the recommendation of BowX’s board of directors in favor of approval of the BCA Proposal, you should keep in mind that
the initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and BowX’s directors and executive officers have interests in such proposal that are different from, or in addition to, those of BowX stockholders and warrant holders generally. These interests
include, among other things, the interests listed below: • the beneficial ownership of our initial stockholders of an aggregate of 12,075,000 shares of BowX
Class B Common Stock and 7,773,000 private placement warrants, which shares and warrants would become worthless if BowX does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period, as our initial stockholders have waived any
redemption right with respect to these shares. Our initial stockholders paid an aggregate of $25,000 for the BowX Class B Common Stock, and $11,660,000 for the private placement warrants, and such shares and warrants have an aggregate market
value of approximately $                 million and $                  million,
respectively, based on the closing price of BowX Class A Common Stock of $                  on Nasdaq on
                 , 2021, the record date for the special meeting of stockholders. Each of our officers and directors is a member of the Sponsor. Vivek Ranadivé
and Murray Rode are the managing members of the Sponsor, and as such Messrs. Ranadivé and Rode have voting and investment discretion with respect to the BowX Common Stock and warrants held of record by the Sponsor; • the anticipated continuation of Mr. Ranadivé as a director of New WeWork; • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to redeem any of their shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve the Business Combination; 13 Table of Contents • the fact that our initial stockholders, including our Sponsor, and our directors and officers, paid an aggregate
of approximately $11,660,000 for their 7,773,333 private placement warrants to purchase shares of BowX Class A Common Stock and that such private placement warrants will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated by
August 7, 2022; • the fact that our initial stockholders, including our Sponsor and its affiliates, who purchased Class B Common
Stock and private placement warrants at the time of our IPO may experience a positive rate of return on their investment, even if our public shareholders experience a negative rate of return on their investment; • that, at the Closing, we will enter into the Registration Rights Agreement, which provides for registration
rights to the initial stockholders, including the Sponsor, and BowX’s directors and officers and their permitted transferees; • the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of BowX and the continuation of directors’
and officers’ liability insurance after the Business Combination; • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, though there
have been no material out-of-pocket expenses subject to reimbursement and BowX does not anticipate any such expenses prior to Closing; and • the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business
combination is not completed. These interests may influence BowX’s directors in making their recommendation that
you vote in favor of the BCA Proposal and the transactions contemplated thereby. These interests were considered by the BowX board of directors when it approved the Business Combination. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of BowX’s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of
such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for
the proposals. In addition, BowX’s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. Interests of WeWork’s Executive Officers in the Business Combination Certain of the officers of WeWork also have interests in the Business Combination, including eligibility for and entitlement to certain
transaction bonuses and the commencement of vesting of certain equity awards. WeWork previously established certain bonus arrangements
that would result in payment(s) in connection with a qualifying capital raise and/or the public listing of WeWork. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, Sandeep Mathrani, WeWork’s Chief Executive Officer, will be entitled to a
payment of $10.0 million subject to repayment obligations that provide that the full after-tax amount of the payment must be repaid if Mr. Mathrani resigns without good reason or is terminated for cause on or prior to January 31, 2022, and 50% of
such after-tax amount must be repaid in the event of such a termination after January 31, 2022, but on or before January 31, 2023. In addition, the following bonus amounts have been allocated to WeWork’s other executive officers: Anthony
Yazbeck ($2.0 million), Ben Dunham ($1.5 million), Jared DeMatteis ($1.5 million), Lauren Fritts ($1.0 million), Peter Greenspan ($1.0 million), Hamid Hashemi ($750,000), Scott Morey ($300,000), Maral Kazanjian ($250,000) and Roger Solé
Rafols ($250,000). These amounts are subject to the same repayment obligations as are described above with respect to the payment to Mr. Mathrani, but are target 14 Table of Contents amounts only and may be adjusted up or down in the sole discretion of Mr. Mathrani (subject to an aggregate cap of $11.5 million). In connection with his promotion to President & Chief
Operating Officer, Anthony Yazbeck also received a one-time bonus of GBP 1.44 million which will be payable within 30 days following the consummation of the Business Combination subject to his employment through the payment date. WeWork’s executive officers also hold certain WeWork Restricted Stock Unit Awards which have, as a condition to vesting, the satisfaction
of a liquidity event condition in addition to service- and/or performance-based vesting requirements. The consummation of the Business Combination will satisfy the liquidity event condition for those WeWork Restricted Stock Unit Awards. As of July
15, 2021, an aggregate of 4,347,818 such restricted stock units (assuming performance metrics are achieved at the maximum level and not reflecting adjustments in connection with the Business Combination) were held by executive officers, 8,863 of
which will be fully vested upon the consummation of the Business Combination, with the remainder remaining subject to additional service- and/or performance-based vesting requirements. Recommendation to Stockholders of BowX BowX’s board of directors believes that the BCA Proposal and the other proposals to be presented at the special meeting are in the best
interest of BowX’s stockholders and unanimously recommends that its stockholders vote “FOR” the BCA Proposal, “FOR” the Stock Issuance Proposal, “FOR” each of the separate Organizational Documents Proposals,
“FOR” the Director Election Proposal, “FOR” the Equity Incentive Plan Proposal, “FOR” the ESPP Proposal and “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, in each case, if presented to the special meeting. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of BowX’s directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of
such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of BowX and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for
the proposals. In addition, BowX’s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — Interests of BowX ’ s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination ” for a further discussion of these considerations. BowX’s Board of
Directors’ Reasons for the Business Combination BowX was organized effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. In evaluating the Business Combination,
the BowX board of directors consulted with BowX’s management and considered a number of factors. In particular, the BowX board of directors considered, among other things, the following factors, although not weighted or in any order of
significance: • The WeWork Business . The following factors related to WeWork and its business and operations: • Large and Growing Addressable Market. WeWork has an opportunity to grow flexible workspace market
share in the multi-trillion-dollar commercial real estate market. As we believe the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate the shift away from traditional office space, information reviewed
by the BowX board of directors suggested that flexible workspaces could potentially represent up to 22.2% of the U.S. office real-estate market by 2030, positioning WeWork for substantial revenue growth, even assuming WeWork’s market share of
the flexible workspace market share remains constant. WeWork also plans to continue to diversify across geographies, while maintaining a strong presence in the United States. 15 Table of Contents • Portfolio of Product Offerings. WeWork offers solutions for companies of all sizes. WeWork’s
broad product offerings include WeWork On Demand, which provides users pay-as-you-go access to book individual workspace or
conference rooms at nearby WeWork locations; WeWork All Access, a monthly subscription-based model that provides members with access to participating WeWork locations; and a marketplace offering that provides business and technical service
solutions, including professional employer organization (“PEO”) and payroll services, remote workforce solutions, human resources benefits, dedicated bandwidth, and IT equipment co-location. • Platform Business Opportunity . WeWork is currently developing a platform that would leverage its systems
and established global customer base to offer landlords and operators the ability to power and manage flexible spaces in their portfolio. • Experienced and Proven Management Team . WeWork’s management team has decades of public market
experience and has demonstrated proven results within their first 12 months at WeWork. WeWork’s management team is led by Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure and Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani, who joined WeWork in February 2020. Under
their leadership, WeWork has refocused on its core business model and applied a disciplined approach to costs. The BowX board of directors considered that WeWork’s executives will continue with the combined company following the Business
Combination. For additional information regarding WeWork’s executive officers, see the section entitled “ Management of New WeWork Following the Business Combination — Executive
Officers .” • Attractive Initial Valuation . WeWork will have an anticipated initial pre-transaction enterprise value of $8.8 billion. • Results of Due Diligence. The results of a due diligence investigation conducted by BowX’s
management team and outside advisors from February 22, 2021 to March 23, 2021, such investigation including: • extensive virtual meetings and calls with WeWork’s management team regarding its operations, business plan
and the proposed transaction; and • review of materials related to WeWork and its business, made available by WeWork and deemed appropriate for
review in the context of the size of the transaction and the scope of WeWork’s operations, including financial statements, material contracts, key metrics and performance • indicators, benefit plans, employee compensation and labor matters, intellectual property matters, real property
matters, information technology, privacy and personal data, litigation information, environmental matters and other regulatory and compliance matters and other legal and business information. • Continued Ownership By Current WeWork Stockholders. WeWork’s existing equityholders would be
receiving a significant amount of BowX’s common stock as its consideration and 100% of the existing equityholders of WeWork are “rolling over” their existing equity interests into equity interests in WeWork, which would represent
approximately 82.4% of the pro forma ownership of the combined company after Closing, after giving effect to the PIPE Investment and assuming none of BowX’s current public shareholders exercise their redemption rights in connection with the
Business Combination. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal—Ownership of New WeWork After the Closing. ” • Stockholder Liquidity. The obligation in the Merger Agreement to have the BowX Class A Common
Stock issued as merger consideration listed on a major U.S. stock exchange, which the BowX board of directors believes has the potential to offer BowX stockholders greater liquidity. • PIPE Investment . Certain third parties, including top-tier institutional investors, are investing an additional $800 million in the combined company pursuant to their participation in the PIPE 16 Table of Contents Investment. The BowX board of directors considered this a strong sign of confidence in WeWork following the Business Combination and the benefits expected to be realized as a result of the
Business Combination. • Use of Proceeds. The proceeds to be delivered to the combined company in connection with the Business
Combination (including from BowX’s trust account and from the PIPE Investment) are expected to be used after Closing in order to fund WeWork’s existing operations and support new and existing growth initiatives. • Terms of the Merger Agreement . The terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements including the
parties’ conditions to their respective obligations to complete the transactions contemplated therein and their ability to terminate such agreements. See the section entitled “ BCA Proposal ” for detailed discussions of the terms
and conditions of these agreements. • Other Alternatives . The determination that the proposed Business Combination, after a thorough review of
other business combination opportunities reasonably available to BowX, represents the best potential business combination for BowX. No opportunity came to the attention of any member of BowX’s management or Board of Directors in his or her
personal capacity, which impacted BowX’s search for an acquisition target. This explanation of the BowX board of
directors’ reasons for its approval of the Business Combination, and all other information presented in this section, is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section entitled
“ Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .” For a more complete description of the BowX board of
directors’ reasons for approving the Business Combination, including other factors and risks considered by the BowX board of directors, see the section entitled “ BCA Proposal — BowX’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the
Business Combination. ” U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations For a discussion summarizing the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the exercise of redemption rights, please see the section entitled
“ Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Stockholders Exercising Redemption Rights .” For a discussion
summarizing the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Mergers for WeWork Stockholders, please see the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers for WeWork Stockholders.” Expected Accounting Treatment We expect
the Business Combination to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under the guidance in ASC 805, BowX is expected to be
treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. This determination was primarily based on existing WeWork Stockholders comprising a relative majority of the voting power of the combined company, WeWork’s operations
prior to the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of New WeWork, the majority of New WeWork’s board of directors being appointed by WeWork, and WeWork’s senior management comprising a majority of the senior management of New
WeWork. Accordingly, the Business Combination is expected to be reflected as the equivalent of WeWork issuing stock for the net assets of BowX, accompanied by a recapitalization whereby no goodwill or other intangible assets are recorded. Operations
prior to the Business Combination will be those of WeWork. 17 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder, certain transactions may not be consummated unless information has been
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“Antitrust Division”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The Business Combination is subject to
these requirements and may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-day waiting period following the two filings of the required Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC or
until early termination is granted. On April 8, 2021, the parties both filed their respective required forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Business Combination with the Antitrust Division and the FTC and requested early termination. The
waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on May 10, 2021. At any time before or after consummation of the Transaction,
notwithstanding termination of the respective waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Department of Justice or the FTC, or any state or foreign governmental authority could take such action under applicable antitrust laws as such authority deems
necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Business Combination, conditionally approving the Business Combination upon divestiture of assets, subjecting the completion of the Business
Combination to regulatory conditions or seeking other remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. BowX and WeWork cannot assure you that the Antitrust Division, the FTC, any
state attorney general or any other government authority will not attempt to challenge the Business Combination on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is made, BowX and WeWork cannot assure you as to its result. A merger control filing may be required in Mexico by COFECE. WeWork submitted a filing to COFECE, jointly with BowX, on April 29, 2021.
The filing would be withdrawn if COFECE takes the position that it is not required. Neither of BowX nor WeWork are aware of any material
regulatory approvals or actions that are required for completion of the Business Combination other than the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the filing to COFECE. It is presently contemplated that if any
such additional regulatory approvals or actions are required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or actions will be obtained. Emerging Growth Company BowX is an
“emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in BowX’s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously
approved. Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised
financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with
the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. BowX has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has 18 Table of Contents different application dates for public or private companies, BowX, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. This may make comparison of BowX’s financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth
anniversary of the closing of BowX’s initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value
of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than
$1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. Risk Factors You should consider
all the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus in deciding how to vote for the proposals presented in this proxy statement/prospectus. These risks are discussed more fully in the section entitled “Risk Factors” following
this summary. If any of these risks actually occur, WeWork’s, BowX’s or New WeWork’s business, financial condition or results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. These risks include, but are not limited to,
the following: • The price of New WeWork’s Common Stock and warrants may be volatile. • If analysts do not publish research about New WeWork’s business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable
research, New WeWork’s stock price and trading volume could decline. • New WeWork may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. • WeWork may not be able to continue to retain existing members, many of whom enter into membership agreements with
short-term commitments, or to attract new members in sufficient numbers or at sufficient rates to sustain and increase its memberships or at all. • WeWork has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in accordance with
GAAP). • WeWork’s success depends on its ability to maintain the value and reputation of its brand and the success of
its strategic partnerships. • WeWork has reduced and may continue to reduce the overall size of its organization and is likely to experience
voluntary attrition, which may present challenges in managing its business. • WeWork’s internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company
and a company of its global scale. • WeWork relies on a combination of proprietary and third-party technology systems to support its business and
member experience, and, if these systems experience difficulties, WeWork’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected. • WeWork and its subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of their indebtedness and
other obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy their obligations, which may not be successful. • Failure to comply with anti-money laundering requirements could subject WeWork to enforcement actions, fines,
penalties, sanctions and other remedial actions. 19 Table of Contents • WeWork’s only material assets are its indirect interests in the WeWork Partnership (defined below), and
WeWork is accordingly dependent upon distributions from the WeWork Partnership to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses. WeWork’s debt facilities also impose or may in the future impose certain restrictions on WeWork’s subsidiaries
making distributions to WeWork. • The announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt New WeWork’s relationships with its
customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as its operating results and business generally. • Since the Sponsor and BowX’s directors and executive officers have interests that are different than the
interests of BowX’s stockholders, a conflict of interest may have existed in determining whether the Business Combination with WeWork is appropriate. • The exercise of BowX’s directors’ and executive officers’ discretion in agreeing to changes or
waivers in the terms of the Business Combination may result in a conflict of interest. • The NYSE, may not list New WeWork’s securities on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to
make transactions in New WeWork’s securities and subject New WeWork to additional trading restrictions. • BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider, and consequently, you have no assurance
from an independent source that the Business Combination is fair to BowX from a financial point of view. • BowX does not have a specified maximum redemption threshold, but cannot consummate the Business Combination if
its net tangible assets fall below $5,000,001. This threshold and the Minimum Available Cash Condition (as defined below) may make it more difficult for it to complete the Business Combination as contemplated. • Public stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of New WeWork Common
Stock as consideration in the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment and due to future issuances pursuant to the 2021 Plan, the First Warrant, the LC Warrant and the exercise of public warrants and private warrants. Having a minority stock
ownership position may reduce the influence that BowX’s current stockholders have on the management of New WeWork. • Warrants will become exercisable for New WeWork Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible
for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders. Such dilution will increase if more of our shares are redeemed. 20 Table of Contents SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BOWX The selected historical condensed statements of operations data of BowX for the period from May 19, 2020, (date of inception) to

of the VIEs. See Note 5 and Note 6 of the notes to WeWork’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated and annual audited consolidated financial statements, respectively, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. 24 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures To evaluate the performance of its business, WeWork relies on both its results of operations recorded in accordance with GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. These measures, as defined below, are not defined or calculated under principles, standards or rules that comprise GAAP. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measures WeWork uses and refer to should not be viewed as a substitute for net loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as a substitute for cash flows from
operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and we encourage you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, financial condition or results of operations. WeWork’s definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow
described below are specific to our business and you should not assume that they are comparable to similarly titled financial measures of other companies. WeWork defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net loss before income tax (benefit) provision, interest and other (income) expense,
depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, expense related to stock-based payments for services rendered by consultants, income or expense relating to the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities remeasured to
fair value on a recurring basis, expense related to costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and capital raising activities, legal, tax and regulatory reserves or settlements, significant legal costs incurred by WeWork in connection
with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork’s 2019 withdrawn initial public offering and the related execution of the SoftBank Transactions, as defined in Note 1 of the notes to WeWork’s consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, net of any insurance or other recoveries, significant non-ordinary course asset impairment charges and, to the extent applicable, any impact of
discontinued operations, restructuring charges, and other gains and losses on operating assets. WeWork defines Free Cash Flow as cash
flow from operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment, each as presented in WeWork’s consolidated statements of cash flows calculated in accordance with GAAP. Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ (894,579 ) $ (1,883,444 ) $ (2,200,591 ) $ (1,171,597 ) Free Cash Flow (2) (1,312,099 ) (2,298,240 ) (3,936,330 ) (2,231,749 ) (1) A reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in the section
entitled “ WeWork’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Adjusted EBITDA .” (2) A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, to
Free Cash Flow is set forth in the section entitled “ WeWork’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Non-GAAP Financial Measures –
Free Cash Flow .” 25 Table of Contents SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION The following summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2021, and the summary unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, present the combination of the financial information of BowX and WeWork after giving effect to the Business
Combination, PIPE Investment, recapitalization (collectively, the “Business Combination and Related Transactions”) and related adjustments described in the accompanying notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information,
and have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The summary unaudited pro
forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 combines the historical balance sheet of BowX and the historical consolidated balance sheet of WeWork on a pro forma basis as if the Business Combination and Related Transactions, summarized
below, had been consummated on June 30, 2021. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, combine the historical statement of
operations of BowX and WeWork for such period on a pro forma basis as if the transaction, summarized below, had been consummated on January 1, 2020, the beginning of the earliest period presented: • The merger of WeWork with and into BowX Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of BowX, with WeWork surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of BowX; • The issuance and sale of 80,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock for $10.00 per share and an
aggregate purchase price of $800 million in the PIPE Investment pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, executed concurrently with the Merger Agreement; • The conversion of 9,075,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock into 9,075,000 shares of New WeWork
Class A Common Stock in connection with the transaction in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; • The exchange of all issued and outstanding WeWork Preferred Stock into a number of shares of New WeWork
Class A Common Stock based on the Exchange Ratio; • The issuance of the First Warrant to SBWW and/or its designees to purchase New WeWork Class A Common Stock
based on the Exchange Ratio; • The exchange of all issued and outstanding WeWork Common Stock into a number of shares of New WeWork Common Stock
based on the Exchange Ratio. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on and
should be read in conjunction with the audited historical financial statements of each of BowX and WeWork and the notes thereto, as well as the disclosures contained in the sections titled “ BowX’s Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and “ WeWork’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .” The following tables present selected pro forma information after giving effect to the Business Combination and Related Transactions presented
under two scenarios: • Assuming No Redemption: This presentation assumes that no public stockholders of BowX exercise redemption
rights with respect to their public shares for a pro rata share of the funds in the trust account. • Assuming Maximum Possible Redemption: This presentation assumes 43,231,098 of the public shares are
redeemed for their pro rata share of the funds in BowX’s trust account. This scenario gives effect to BowX’s public share redemptions of 43,231,098 shares for aggregate redemption payments of 26 Table of Contents $432.3 million. The Merger Agreement includes as a condition to closing the business combination that, at the closing, BowX will have a minimum of $800 million in cash comprising
(i) the amount of cash available in the trust account immediately prior to closing, after deducting the amount required to satisfy the share redemption amount (but prior to payment of any (a) deferred underwriting commissions held in the
trust account and (b) any transaction expenses of WeWork and BowX), and (ii) the PIPE investment amount received by BowX prior to or substantially concurrently with the closing. The proceeds from the PIPE investment are expected to satisfy
the minimum cash requirement. The figures in the following tables are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the
scenarios described above, which may be different from the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but
the number of shares redeemed is less than 43,231,098, the values set forth below will fall between the two scenarios. Summary Unaudited Pro Forma

per share information after giving effect to the Business Combination, assuming two redemption scenarios as follows: The following tables
present selected pro forma information after giving effect to the Business Combination and Related Transactions presented under two scenarios: • Assuming No Redemption: This presentation assumes that no public stockholders of BowX exercise redemption
rights with respect to their public shares for a pro rata share of the funds in the trust account. • Assuming Maximum Possible Redemption: This presentation assumes 43,231,098 of the public shares are
redeemed for their pro rata share of the funds in BowX’s trust account. This scenario gives effect to BowX’s public share redemptions of 43,231,098 shares for aggregate redemption payments of $432.3 million. The Merger Agreement
includes as a condition to closing the Business Combination that, at the closing, BowX will have a minimum of $800 million in cash comprising (i) the amount of cash available in the trust account immediately prior to Closing, after
deducting the amount required to satisfy the share redemption amount (but prior to payment of any (a) deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and (b) any transaction expenses of WeWork and BowX), and (ii) the PIPE
investment amount received by BowX prior to or substantially concurrently with the closing. The proceeds from the PIPE investment are expected to satisfy the minimum cash requirement. The figures in the following tables are presented only as illustrative examples and are based on the scenarios described above, which may be different from
the actual amount of redemptions in connection with the Business Combination. In the event that shares of BowX Class A Common Stock are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination but the number of shares redeemed is less than 43,231,098,
the values set forth below will fall between the two scenarios. The pro forma book value information reflects the Business Combination as
if it had occurred on June 30, 2021. The weighted average shares outstanding and net earnings per share information reflect the Business Combination as if it had occurred at the beginning of the period. This information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of BowX and WeWork and related
notes included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined per share information of BowX and WeWork is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined earnings (loss) per
share information below does not purport to represent the earnings (loss) per share which would have occurred had the companies been combined during the periods presented, nor earnings per share for any future date or period. The unaudited pro forma
combined book value per share information below does not purport to represent what the value of BowX and WeWork would have been had the companies been combined during the periods presented. The liquidation and dividend rights are identical among Class A and Class B common stock, and both classes of common stock share
equally in our earnings and losses. 28 Table of Contents The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted pro forma net loss per share

“BOWXU” and “BOWX” and “BOWXW,” respectively. The closing price of the BowX Units, BowX Class A Common
Stock and public warrants as of March 25, 2021, the last trading day before announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, was $9.98, $9.73 and $1.07, respectively. As
of                , 2021, the record date for the special meeting, the most recent closing price for the units, common stock and redeemable warrants was
$                 , $                and
$                 , respectively. Holders of the BowX Units, BowX
Class A Common Stock and public warrants should obtain current market quotations for their securities. The market price of BowX’s securities could vary at any time before the Business Combination. Dividend Policy BowX has not paid any
cash dividends on the BowX Common Stock to date and does not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of the Business Combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon the revenues and earnings, if any,
capital requirements and general financial condition of New WeWork subsequent to completion of the Business Combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to the Business Combination will be within the discretion of New WeWork’s
board of directors. BowX’s board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring cash or stock dividends, nor is it currently expected that New WeWork’s board of directors will declare any cash or stock
dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, the ability of New WeWork to declare cash or stock dividends may be limited by the terms of financing or other agreements entered into by New WeWork or its subsidiaries from time to time. Price Range of WeWork’s Securities Historical market price information regarding WeWork is not provided because there is no public market for WeWork’s securities. For
information regarding WeWork’s liquidity and capital resources, see the section entitled “ WeWork ’ s Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources .” 30 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the heading
“Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote on the proposals presented in this proxy statement/prospectus. The risk factors described below disclose both material and other
risks, and are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows in future periods or are not identified because they are generally common to businesses. Unless
otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to the business of WeWork and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the
Business Combination, which will be the business of New WeWork and its subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination; except that, with respect to references to the Company’s lease obligations, the “Company”
refers to the WeWork subsidiary that is a party to such lease. Risks Relating to the Company’s Business The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows, and recovery from the pandemic may take longer than anticipated. The global spread and unprecedented
impact of COVID-19, including variants of the virus (particularly the Delta variant), has resulted in significant disruption and has created additional risks to the Company’s and its joint ventures
partners’ businesses, the industry and the economy. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Since that time, COVID-19 has resulted in various governments imposing numerous restrictions at different times, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home orders, social distancing requirements and mandatory closure of “non-essential” businesses. As a result, the Company’s and its joint ventures partners’ businesses were significantly disrupted, and their operations have been
significantly reduced. In particular, markets in which the Company and its joint venture partners operate both in the United States and internationally, and the state and local governments in these areas, among others, have in the past implemented stay-at-home orders, social distancing requirements and mandatory closures of all “non-essential” businesses, and have either re-implemented or may in the future re-implement these or other restrictions, in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. In
response to these measures, the Company and its joint venture partners have temporarily closed certain locations in various U.S. and international markets and may do so in the future, in an effort to adhere to local guidance, help protect the health
and safety of its employees and members, and various planned new location openings have been delayed. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including
employee travel, employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the
best interests of the Company’s employees and members. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company’s and its
joint ventures partners’ ability to perform critical functions, including operating its locations, could be further adversely affected. The Company also experienced a reduction in new sales volume at its locations, which negatively affected, and may continue to negatively
affect, the Company’s results of operations. The Company had also been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by member churn, non-payment (or delayed payment) from members or members seeking payment
concessions or deferrals or cancellations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s total memberships,
including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%. There is no guarantee that membership numbers will return to pre- COVID-19 pandemic levels. In addition, in relation to non-payment, the Company recorded $17.2 million and $67.5 million
in bad debt expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to $21.0 million and $22.2 million during 31 Table of Contents the six months ended June 30, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also determined collectability was not probable and did not recognize revenue on certain contracts totaling $2.1
million and $53.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. See the section entitled “ WeWork’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Covid-19 and Impact on our Business. ” The Company expects the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in light of the spread of variants of the virus, such as the Delta variant, may continue to have an impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, but the Company is unable to predict how
long that impact will continue. In particular, even after state and local governments lift mandatory restrictions, the Company’s business could be adversely impacted by the following: public perception of the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its members, including their financial situation and ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to
the Company; unemployment rates; reduction in demand from any of the foregoing; or due to customers or potential customers deferring return-to-office plans, as well as considering remote and hybrid office space arrangements; increased costs as a
result of measures required to be taken, or that the Company elects to take, to protect the health and safety of its employees and members, including costs of potential health screenings, enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols and compliance
with any regulations or policies regarding reduced occupancy or social distancing, which could require reconfiguration of spaces at the Company’s locations. The extent to which the Company is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak (including variants of the virus), its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the
development of vaccines and rollout of effective immunization programs, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, including how quickly the Company can resume normal operations and how quickly, if at
all, the Company can return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic also had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company’s cash
flow and liquidity. The extent of the continued impact will depend in part on the Company’s continued ability to implement its transformation efforts. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and
may continue to cause, significant disruption of financial markets, which could reduce the Company’s ability to access capital, which could further negatively affect its liquidity. In addition, the value of some of the Company’s assets
have declined, and may continue to decline, which may result in material non-cash impairment charges in future periods. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting declines in revenue and operating
income experienced by certain locations during 2020 and 2021, we identified certain assets whose carrying value was now deemed to have been partially impaired. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, WeWork
recorded $31.5 million and $345.0 million, respectively, in impairments, primarily as a result of decreases in projected cash flows primarily attributable to the impact of COVID-19. See Note 3 of the notes to WeWork’s audited annual and
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience pricing challenges in the market place due to an excess
supply of commercial real estate available to customers or potential customers as a result of companies deferring their return-to-office plans, as well as businesses considering remote and hybrid office space arrangements. The current and future potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also could have the effect of
heightening many of the other risks described under this section entitled “Risk Factors” in this proxy statement/prospectus, including, among others, those relating to the Company’s high level of indebtedness and need to generate
sufficient cash flows to service its indebtedness, and the Company’s ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern its indebtedness and other obligations. The Company may not be able to continue to retain existing members, many of whom enter into membership agreements with short-term commitments, or to
attract new members in sufficient numbers or at sufficient rates to sustain and increase its memberships or at all. The Company
principally generates revenues through the sale of memberships. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, higher levels of membership 32 Table of Contents agreement terminations. Specifically, between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel
locations, declined 16%. In addition, in many cases, members may terminate their membership agreements with the Company at any time upon as little notice as one calendar month, generally for a fee. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, on
average, approximately 10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments and could be terminated in a given month. Similarly, there are also longer-term or multi-year memberships that come up for renewal each month pursuant to the ordinary
course terms of the contract, generally evenly throughout the year. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 6% of physical memberships (excluding month-to-month commitments) came up for renewal each month on average. Members may
cancel their memberships for many reasons, including a perception that they do not make sufficient use of the Company’s solutions and services, that they need to reduce their expenses or that alternative work environments may provide better
value or a better experience. Negative publicity surrounding the Company may also result in an increase in membership agreement terminations, a decrease in the Company’s ability to attract new members or weaker sales and slower ramp-up of the Company’s new locations. The Company’s results of operations could be
adversely affected by declines in demand for its memberships. Demand for its memberships has been and may continue to be negatively affected by public health concerns, and could also be affected by a number of factors, including geopolitical
uncertainty, competition, cybersecurity incidents, decline in the Company’s reputation and saturation in the markets where the Company operates. For example, reduced sales volume as a result of COVID-19, have negatively affected and may
continue to affect the Company’s results of operations. Prevailing general and local economic conditions may also negatively affect the demand for its memberships, particularly from current and potential members that are small- and mid-sized businesses and may be disproportionately affected by adverse economic conditions. If the Company is unable to
replace members who may terminate their membership agreements, the Company’s cash flows and the Company’s ability to make payments under their lease agreements may be adversely affected. These same factors that reduce demand for its
memberships may not have the same impact on a landlord that has longer commitments from its tenants than the Company has from its members. The Company must continually add new members both to replace departing members and to expand its current member base. The Company may not be
able to attract new members in sufficient numbers to fully replace departing members. In addition, the revenue the Company generates from new members may not be as high as the revenue generated from existing members because of discounts the Company
may offer to these new members, which have increased in recent periods, and the Company may incur marketing or other expenses, including referral fees, to attract new members, which may further offset its revenues from these new members. For these
and other reasons, the Company could continue to experience a decline in its revenue growth, which could adversely affect its results of operations. An economic downturn or subsequent declines in market rents may result in increased member terminations and could adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations. While the Company believes that it has a durable business model in all economic cycles, there can be no
assurance that this will be the case. A significant portion of the Company’s member base consists of small- and mid-sized businesses and freelancers who may be disproportionately affected by adverse
economic conditions. In addition, the Company’s concentration in specific cities magnifies the risk to the Company of adverse localized economic conditions in those cities or the surrounding regions. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the
Company generated the majority of its revenue from locations in the United States and the United Kingdom. The majority of the Company’s 2021 revenue from locations in the United States was generated from locations in the greater New York City,
San Francisco, Boston, San Jose and Seattle markets. A majority of its locations in the United Kingdom are in London. Economic downturns in these markets or other markets in which the Company is growing its number of locations may have a
disproportionate effect on the Company’s revenue and its ability to retain members, in particular among members that are small- and mid-sized businesses, and thereby require the Company to expend time and
resources on sales and marketing activities that may not be successful and could 33 Table of Contents impair its results of operations. Additionally, an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic or any similar illness, has had
and may continue to have a disproportionate effect on businesses located in large metropolitan areas (such as those listed above), as larger cities are more likely to institute a quarantine or “shelter-in-place”. Furthermore, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, increased churn and non-payment from members negatively affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where it operates, which can result in a general decline in real
estate activity, reduce demand for its solutions and services and exert downward pressure on its revenue. The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the
Company’s leases may limit the Company’s operating flexibility and could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. The Company’s leases are primarily entered into by and through special purpose entity subsidiaries. The Company currently leases a
significant majority of its locations under long-term leases that, with limited exceptions, do not contain early termination provisions. The Company’s obligations to landlords under these agreements extend for periods that generally
significantly exceed the length of its membership agreements with its members, which in certain cases may be terminated by the Company’s members upon as little notice as one calendar month. The average length of the initial term of its leases
is approximately 15 years, and the average term of its membership agreements is 15 months. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s subsidiaries’ future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance
leases was $36.6 billion and committed sales contracts to be recognized as revenue in the future totaled approximately $3 billion. However, as of June 30, 2021, the total security packages, including in the form of corporate guarantees,
outstanding letters of credit, cash security deposits to landlords and surety bonds issued, provided by the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of those lease obligations was approximately $6.5 billion, representing less than 20% of future
undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations. In addition, individual property lease security obligations on any given lease typically decrease over the life of the lease, although the Company or its subsidiaries may continue to enter into
new leases in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s leases generally provide for fixed monthly or quarterly payments that
are not tied to space utilization or the size of its member base, and nearly all of its leases contain minimum rental payment obligations. There are a small number of leases under a revenue sharing model with no minimum rent amount. As a result, in
locations where the Company does not generate sufficient revenue from members at a particular space, including if members terminate their membership agreements with the Company and the Company is not able to replace these departing members or the
Company ceases to operate at leased spaces, the Company’s lease cost expense exceeds its revenue. In addition, the Company may not be able to negotiate lower fixed monthly payments under its leases at rates which are commensurate with the rates
at which the Company may agree to lower its monthly membership fees, which may also result in its rent expense exceeding its membership and service revenue. At certain locations, the Company has not been able to, and may not be able to, reduce its
rent under the lease or otherwise terminate the lease, whether in accordance with its terms or by negotiation. If the Company experiences
a prolonged reduction in revenues at a particular leased location, including as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, its results of operations in respect of that space would be adversely affected unless
and until the lease expires or the Company is able to assign the lease or sublease the space to a third party or otherwise renegotiate the terms of the lease or an exit from that space. The Company’s ability to assign a lease or sublease for a
particular space to a third party may be constrained by provisions in the lease that restrict these transfers without notice to, or the prior consent of, the landlord. Additionally, the Company could incur significant costs if it decides to assign
or sublease unprofitable leases, as the Company may incur transaction costs associated with finding and negotiating with potential transferees, and the ultimate transferee may require upfront payments or other inducements. The Company is also party
to a variety of lease agreements and other occupancy arrangements, including management agreements and participating leases, containing a variety of contractual rights and obligations that may be subject to interpretation. The Company’s
interpretation 34 Table of Contents of such contracts may be disputed by its landlords or members, which could result in litigation, damage to its reputation or contractual or other legal remedies becoming available to such
landlords and members and may impact its results of operations. While the Company’s leases are often held by special purpose
entities, the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations depend on the ability of its subsidiaries to perform their obligations under these leases over time. The Company’s business, reputation, financial condition
and results of operations depend on the Company’s ongoing compliance with its leases. In addition, the Company provides credit support in respect of its leases in the form of letters of credit, limited corporate guarantees (mostly from a
subsidiary of WeWork), cash security deposits and surety bonds. See the section entitled “ WeWork ’ s Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Lease Obligations. ” The applicable landlords have and could draw under the letters of credit or demand payment under the surety bonds, which amounts would need to be funded by the Company or one
of its subsidiaries, which has and could further adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and liquidity. In addition, under the Company’s surety bonds, the applicable surety has the right to increase their collateral to 100% of
the outstanding bond amounts, including cash collateral or letters of credit, at any time the surety bonds are outstanding. Some sureties have already exercised this option. In certain circumstances, landlords have drawn under the letters of credit
or demanded payment under the surety bonds in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease and security instrument. In addition, a small number of landlords have sued to enforce the corporate guarantees. The Company is also increasingly
pursuing strategic alternatives to pure leasing arrangements, including management agreements, participating leases and other occupancy arrangements with respect to spaces. Some of the Company’s agreements contain penalties that are payable in
the event the Company terminates the arrangement. The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in
accordance with GAAP). The Company had an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2021, December 31, 2020 and 2019 and had net losses of
$3.0 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s accumulated deficit and net losses,
which are GAAP financial metrics, historically resulted primarily from the substantial investments required to grow its business, including a significant increase in the number of locations in which the Company operates. The operation of non-core businesses in the past has also contributed to accumulated deficit and net loss historically. The Company’s rapid growth placed a significant strain on the Company’s resources. In addition, the
Company has in recent periods incurred restructuring and other related costs in connection with both lease termination charges and lease amendment or exit costs resulting from the Company’s global real estate portfolio optimization efforts as
well as one-time employee-related payments resulting from the Company’s workforce realignment. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business
have also contributed to the losses incurred during 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021. While the Company has initiated and
substantially completed a strategic restructuring with the goal of creating a leaner, more efficient organization to support its long-term goal of sustainable growth, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in realizing the
benefits of this plan. The Company’s operating costs and other expenses may be greater than it anticipates, and its investments to make its business and its operations more efficient may not be successful. Increases in the Company’s costs,
expenses and investments may reduce its margins and materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The
Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain the value and reputation of its brand and the success of its strategic partnerships. The Company’s brand is integral to its business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning the Company’s brand will depend largely on
the Company’s ability to provide a consistently high-quality member experience 35 Table of Contents and on its marketing and community-building efforts. To the extent its locations, workspace solutions or product or service offerings are perceived to be of low quality or otherwise are not
compelling to new and existing members, the Company’s ability to maintain a positive brand reputation may be adversely affected. In
addition, failure by third parties on whom the Company relies but whose actions it cannot control, such as joint venture partners, general contractors and construction managers who oversee its construction activities, or their respective facilities
management staff, to uphold a high standard of workmanship, ethics, conduct and legal compliance could subject the Company to reputational harm based on their association with it and its brand. The Company believes that much of its reputation depends on word-of-mouth and other non-paid sources of opinion, including on the internet. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception or
experience of the Company’s solutions, practices, products or services could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, resulting in difficulties in attracting and retaining members, landlords and business partners (including joint venture
partners), difficulties in attracting and retaining employees, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and limiting the success of the Company’s community-building efforts and the range of solutions, products and services the Company is able to offer. To the extent that the Company is unable to maintain a positive brand reputation organically and to contend with increased competition,
the Company may need to increase or enhance its marketing efforts to attract new members, which would increase its sales and marketing expenses both in absolute terms and as a percentage of its revenue. The Company may be unable to adequately protect or prevent unauthorized use of its intellectual property rights and the Company may be prevented by third
parties from using or registering its intellectual property. To protect its intellectual property rights, the Company relies on a
combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, patent and trade secret protection laws, protective agreements with its employees and third parties and physical and electronic security measures. The Company has obtained a strategic set of
intellectual property registrations and applications, including for the WeWork brand, in certain jurisdictions throughout the world. Nevertheless, these applications may not proceed to registration or issuance or otherwise be granted protection. We
may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent others from copying or using the Company’s intellectual property in certain jurisdictions throughout the world and in jurisdictions where intellectual
property laws may not be adequately developed or favorable to the Company. In addition, third parties may attack the Company’s trademarks, including the WeWork brand, by opposing said applications or canceling registrations on a variety of
bases, including validity and non-use. Third parties have in the past and may, from time to time in the future, claim that the Company is infringing their intellectual property rights or challenge the validity
or enforceability of the Company’s intellectual property rights, and the Company may not be successful in defending these claims. These claims, even without merit, could result in the prevention of the Company registering or enforcing its
intellectual property. These claims can also cause the Company to stop using certain intellectual property and force the Company to rebrand or redesign our marketing, product, or technology. Additionally, the agreements and security measures the
Company has in place may be inadequate or otherwise fail to effectively accomplish their protective purposes. In some cases, the Company may need to litigate these claims or negotiate a settlement that can include a monetary payment, license
arrangement or cause WeWork to stop using certain intellectual property. This may also trigger certain indemnification provisions in third-party license agreements. The Company may be unable to defend its proprietary rights or prevent
infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to it and negatively impact its intellectual property rights. Third parties
may also infringe or misappropriate the Company’s intellectual property rights, including the WeWork brand, and the Company may not be successful in asserting intellectual property rights against third parties. There may be instances where we
may need to resort to litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights. Enforcement of this type can be costly and result in counterclaims or other claims against the Company, including action against our trademark
applications and registrations. 36 Table of Contents In addition, we license certain intellectual property rights, including the WeWork brand, to
joint venture partners and other third parties, including granting our third-party licensed locations the right to use our intellectual property in connection with their operation of certain locations. If a licensee fails to maintain the quality of
the services used in connection with our trademarks, the Company’s rights to and the value of our trademarks could be diminished. Failure to maintain, control and protect the WeWork brand and other intellectual property could negatively affect
the Company’s ability to acquire members, and ultimately, negatively affect our business. If the licensees misuse our intellectual property, then this could lead to third-party claims against the Company and could negatively affect the WeWork
brand. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign
jurisdictions. The legal system in certain foreign jurisdictions, particularly those in certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection which could make it
difficult for the Company to stop the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of its intellectual property rights, or the marketing of competing products or services in violation of its proprietary rights in these jurisdictions. The
Company may not prevail in any such proceedings that it initiates and the damages or other remedies awarded to the Company, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. If the measures the Company has taken to protect the WeWork brand and its other proprietary rights are inadequate to prevent unauthorized use
or misappropriation by third parties or if the Company is prevented from using intellectual property due to successful third-party claims, the value of the WeWork brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and its business and results of
operations may be adversely affected. Cyber-attacks could negatively affect the Company’s business. The Company has in the past and may be, from time to time in the future, subject to attempted or actual cyber-attacks or similar incidents
against the Company and its information technology systems. This could result in a loss of proprietary business information or member information, including personal information of third parties. Although we have implemented security measures designed to protect our information technology systems and the information we maintain from
such events, we still may not be able to prevent cyber-attacks and security breaches. This is, in part, due to the increased sophistication of hackers. Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of member or employee data could cause members to lose
confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications and other information technology systems. Security breaches could expose us to risks of data loss, regulatory review, fines, litigation, and negatively affect the Company’s
business. The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management and there can be no assurances that this new business
strategy will be successful. Following the withdrawal of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with its attempted initial public offering in 2019, there have been substantial changes in the Company’s management and business plan. The Company’s new strategic plan emphasizes
achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations, focusing on optimizing the Company’s existing real estate portfolio of domestic and international locations and executing well on its current pipeline of
locations before seeking growth opportunities. As part of this plan, beginning in the fall of 2019, the Company began a global review of
its locations to optimize its real estate portfolio. This has resulted in strategically executing full or partial lease exits for locations with more limited prospects of profitability. As of June 30, 2021, the Company and its joint venture partners
have negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners around the world, resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments and a reduction in total lease security of approximately $1.1 Billion,
in each case including ChinaCo prior to the ChinaCo Deconsolidation, 37 Table of Contents since December 31, 2019. However, this process is ongoing and there can be no assurance that these efforts will continue to be successful in reducing the Company’s overall lease costs. In
connection with these optimization efforts, at certain locations the Company has withheld, is withholding, or may in the future withhold rent payments for some period of time. In a small number of cases, the Company’s real estate portfolio
optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords. As the process continues, additional litigation could result and the Company could be exposed to breach of contract, eviction or other claims that could result in direct and
indirect costs to the Company and could result in other operational disruptions that could harm its reputation, brand and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred
lease-related termination costs in connection with the aforementioned strategic lease terminations, substantially all being equal to or less than the security coverage of each lease. The Company continues to incur such costs and the Company
anticipates that there will be additional lease termination fees paid in the future, substantially all of which are expected to be equal to or less than the security coverage of each applicable lease. See the section entitled “ WeWork’s
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Restructuring and Impairments .” In addition, as a result of these lease amendments and/or exits, there is a risk of potential churn or
disruption in the member experience for those that are relocated to a nearby building. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has retained approximately 90% of relocated members but there can be no assurance this relocation retention pattern will
continue. See the section entitled “ Risk Factors — Risks relating to the Company’s Business—The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases may limit its operating flexibility and could adversely affect
its liquidity and results of operations.” The Company’s business depends on hiring, developing, retaining and motivating
highly skilled and dedicated team members to support its mission, and failure to do so, including turnover in the Company’s senior management and other key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company strives to attract, motivate, and retain team members who share a dedication to the member community and the Company’s
vision, but may not be successful in doing so. The Company’s U.S.-based team members, including most of its senior management, work for the Company on an at-will basis. Other companies, including
competitors, may be successful in recruiting and hiring team members away from the Company, and it may be difficult for the Company to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. These difficulties may be more acute
following the negative publicity and organizational changes the Company experienced in late 2019. In addition, the Company has
experienced and may continue to experience operational disruptions in the process of building out a new senior management team. Changes to or turnover among senior management or other key personnel could disrupt the Company’s strategic focus or
create uncertainty for management, employees, members, partners, landlords and stockholders. These changes, and the potential failure to retain and recruit senior management and other key employees, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operations and ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of its business. Unexpected or abrupt departures may result in the failure to effectively transfer
institutional knowledge and may impede our ability to act quickly and efficiently in executing our business strategy as we devote resources to recruiting new personnel or transitioning existing personnel to fill those roles. If the Company is unable to effectively manage employee turnover and retain existing key personnel or timely address its hiring needs or
successfully integrate new hires, its employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the success of each of the Company’s new and
existing locations depends on its ability to hire and retain dedicated community managers and community team members. If the Company enters new geographic markets and launches new solutions, products and services, the Company may experience
difficulty attracting employees in the areas it requires. 38 Table of Contents The Company has reduced and may continue to reduce the overall size of its organization and is likely to
experience voluntary attrition, which may present challenges in managing its business. During and since the third quarter of 2019, the
Company has implemented reductions in its workforce and may consider further reductions in the future. Since then, WeWork has reduced its global workforce by approximately 70% through reductions in force, voluntary attrition not replaced,
divestitures and joint venture arrangements. These workforce reductions have resulted in and may result in the loss of some longer-term employees and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain roles and responsibilities across the
organization, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s operations. Given the complexity and nature of the Company’s business, it must continue to implement and improve its managerial, operational and financial systems, manage its
locations and continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel. This could be made more challenging by the workforce reductions and additional measures the Company may take to reduce costs. As a result, the Company’s management may need to
divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day strategic and operational activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these
organizational changes. Further, workforce reductions and additional cost containment measures may have unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond the Company’s intended workforce reductions, reduced employee morale and
employment-related litigation. Employees who are not affected by the workforce reductions may seek alternate employment, which could require the Company to obtain additional support at unplanned additional expense. The Company has significantly moderated and may continue to moderate its growth. The Company’s historical growth rates prior to the end of 2019 are not expected to be indicative of its future growth. The Company has
significantly moderated and may continue to moderate its growth. The Company plans to continue to open locations in which it has already signed a lease while also negotiating strategic lease restructurings and exits as part of its real estate
optimization efforts. The Company’s future growth will be driven by a variety of factors, including member demand and the availability of new locations priced at a level that would enable the Company to construct the location and operate it
profitably on an individual location basis. As the Company optimizes its real estate portfolio, such opportunities to expand in new and existing geographies may become more limited. If the Company is unable to maintain or negotiate satisfactory arrangements in respect of spaces that it occupies, its ability to service its members may
be impaired. Subsidiaries of the Company currently lease real estate for the majority of its locations while the Company is pursuing
asset-light arrangements such as management agreements, regional joint ventures and other occupancy arrangements with real estate owners. The Company may not receive the same possessory rights under such alternative arrangements as it does in a
traditional landlord-tenant relationship. Instead, the Company’s ability to continue to serve its members at spaces occupied pursuant to these alternative arrangements depends on its relationships with strategic partners. With respect to leases, the Company’s renewal options are typically tied to the then-prevailing net effective rent in the open market
(typically leases include a floor of the then rent in effect under the lease). As a result, increases in rental rates in the markets in which the Company operates, particularly in those markets where initial terms under its leases are shorter, could
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the Company’s
ability to extend an expiring lease on favorable terms or to secure an alternate location will depend on then-prevailing conditions in the real estate market, such as overall rental cost increases, competition from other would-be tenants for desirable leased spaces and its relationships with current and prospective building owners and landlords, and may depend on other factors that are not within its control. If the Company is not
able to renew or replace an expiring lease, it may incur significant costs related to vacating that 39 Table of Contents space, surrendering or restoring any tenant improvements, and redeveloping whatever alternative space it is able to find in such subregion, if any. The Company’s ability to extend an
expiring lease on favorable terms may be more difficult following the negative publicity the Company has experienced. In addition, if the
Company elects to or is forced to vacate a space, it could lose members who purchased memberships based on the design, location or other attributes of that particular space and may not be interested in relocating to the other spaces it has
available. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has retained approximately 90% of relocated members but there can be no assurance this relocation retention pattern will continue. Further, the landlord could re-lease the vacated space in competition with the Company’s other locations. The Company has engaged in
transactions with related parties, and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest and could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The Company has historically entered into transactions with related parties, including its significant stockholders, former executive officers
and current and former directors and other employees. In particular, all transactions between the Company and SoftBank Obligor (including with respect to the Company’s debt financing arrangements with SBG (described below)) are related party
transactions. As of June 30, 2021, the amounts outstanding under the Company’s debt financing arrangements with SBG included $1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2020 LC Facility and $2.2 billion in
outstanding indebtedness under the SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt (defined below), in addition to the ability to borrow up to $1.1 billion under the SoftBank Senior Secured Debt (defined below) subject to applicable restrictive covenants in the
agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness. See “ —Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Condition—The terms of the Company’s indebtedness restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability
to respond to changes or take certain actions, including some of which may affect completion of the Company’s strategic plan .” for additional information. The significant amount of indebtedness owed by the Company to SoftBank Obligor
and commitments from SoftBank Obligor to or for the benefit of the Company could present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. In addition, as described above, SBWW
is expected to receive warrants to purchase additional stock in connection with certain modifications to the debt financings described above and in connection with the consummation of the Business Consummation. There are and are likely to continue
to be other arrangements in which New WeWork and SBG entities are participants related to taxes, corporate governance, debt financings, expense reimbursement and other operations. SBWW (and other affiliates of SBG) is expected to be a substantial
stockholder of New WeWork and will have substantial influence of matters of corporate governance for New WeWork, resulting in possible conflicts of interests. In addition, the Company has in the past entered into several transactions with landlord entities in which Adam Neumann, the Company’s
former chief executive officer and former member of the Company’s board of directors, or WeCap Investment Group, which is operated in conjunction with Rhône Group, an investment entity run in part by Steven Langman, a former member of the
Company’s board of directors, has or had an ownership interest. See “ Related Party Transactions – WeWork ” for additional information. As part of the Company’s restructuring, the Company is in ongoing discussions to
exit certain leases with related parties. Transactions with any landlord entity in which related parties hold ownership interests present potential for conflicts of interest, as the interests of the landlord entity and its stockholders may not align
with the interests of the Company with respect to, for example, the exercise of contractual remedies under these leases, such as the treatment of events of default. As is the case for all lease terminations where there are outstanding tenant
improvements amounts owed, any forgiveness of tenant improvements owed for related party transactions is treated as consideration for the terminations. Pursuant to WeWork’s related party transactions policy, all additional material related party transactions that we enter into require
either (i) the unanimous consent of our audit committee or (ii) the approval of a majority of the independent members of our board of directors who are disinterested with respect to such related party transaction. Upon the closing of the
Business Combination, New WeWork will have a new related party transaction policy. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—WeWork’s Policies and Procedures for Related Party 40 Table of Contents Transactions.” Nevertheless, the Company may have achieved more favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties and these transactions, individually or in
the aggregate, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations or may result in government enforcement actions, investigations or other litigation. Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain of its current and former directors and executive officers and shareholders under
the WeWork Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and various other agreements. The Company has agreed to reimburse indemnified parties for certain legal expenses incurred and, in 2020, paid approximately $14 million in legal fees
related to these indemnifications, outside of the amounts covered by insurance. The Company may be required to pay more in legal fees related to these indemnifications in the future and these indemnification arrangements and associated payments may
have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company has entered into an agreement that grants
Mr. Neumann board observer rights. Beginning on February 26, 2022, Mr. Neumann, or if requested by SBG, a designee of Mr. Neumann’s (who shall be subject to SBG’s approval), shall have the right to observe meetings of New WeWork’s
board of directors (and certain committees thereof) in a non-voting observer capacity. Mr. Neumann, or his designee, is also entitled to copies of written materials provided to directors, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the agreement.
Mr. Neumann’s observer rights shall terminate when he ceases to beneficially own equity securities of WeWork (including WeWork Partnerships Profits Interest Units) representing at least 19,028,251 shares of WeWork Class A Common Stock (on an
as-converted basis and as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like). Although WeWork expects that Mr. Neumann or his
representative may express views or may ask questions, there is no such contractual entitlement beyond attending in a customary nonvoting observer capacity, and New WeWork’s board and committee meetings would be presided over by the relevant
chairpersons and subject to such procedures governing conduct of the meeting as may be adopted by the board or relevant committee. The agreement governing the observer right does not entitle Mr. Neumann to participate in any conversations among
directors outside of formal meetings of the New WeWork board and its applicable committees. Similarly, the agreement does not give Mr. Neumann the right to influence decisions to be made or actions to be taken by the New WeWork board or committees.
Mr. Neumann will participate in meetings of the New WeWork board and its applicable committees as a nonvoting board observer — not as a director. The agreement governing the observer right requires that Mr. Neumann or his representative agree to hold in confidence all information
provided under such agreement. New WeWork has also reserved the right under such agreement to withhold information and exclude Mr. Neumann or his representative from any meeting or portion thereof to the extent reasonably likely to adversely affect
the attorney-client privilege between New WeWork and its counsel or result in disclosure of trade secrets or a conflict of interest, or if there has been a violation of Mr. Neumann’s restrictive covenant obligations to New WeWork. A significant part of the Company’s international growth strategy and international operations may be conducted through joint ventures or other
management arrangements. The Company’s international growth strategy
historically included entering into joint ventures in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Greater China, Japan and the broader Asia-Pacific region. The Company’s success in these regions is therefore
partially dependent on third parties whose actions the Company cannot control. Certain changes to those arrangements have occurred during 2020. In April 2020, the Company closed the “PacificCo Roll-up” and issued 34,482,759 shares of convertible WeWork Series H-1 Preferred Stock to SVFE, making WeWork Asia Holding Company B.V. (“PacificCo”) a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On September 3, 2020, affiliates of Trustbridge Partners signed definitive investment documentation with WeWork Greater China Holding Company B.V. (“ChinaCo”) and its shareholders pursuant to
which (i) certain affiliates of Trustbridge Partners agreed to invest $200 million in ChinaCo in exchange for newly issued preference shares in ChinaCo and (ii) other ChinaCo shareholders (including the Company and SVFE) agreed to
have their interests 41 Table of Contents in ChinaCo restructured (the “Trustbridge Transaction”). The initial closing of the Trustbridge Transaction occurred on October 2, 2020, resulting in affiliates of Trustbridge
Partners becoming the controlling and largest shareholders of ChinaCo. The Company’s joint venture with affiliated investment funds of SVFE in Japan is expected to continue. Separately, the Company intends, as part of its strategic plan, to pursue additional joint ventures and other strategic partnerships,
including management agreements and alternative deal structures with variable rent. In particular, the Company is building a framework to further support joint venture arrangements under which it may transfer a controlling equity interest in its
operations in certain markets to a local partner while retaining minority ownership in, and a percentage of revenue from, such operations. For example, in June 2021, WeWork closed a transaction with Ampa Group (“Ampa”), one of the leading
real estate companies in Israel, pursuant to which Ampa will have the exclusive right to operate WeWork’s business in Israel (the “Israel Transaction”). The Company’s partners in these joint ventures and other arrangements may have interests that differ from the Company’s, and the
Company may disagree with its partners as to the resolution of a particular issue or as to the management or conduct of the business in general. These arrangements may also carry high inherent anti-corruption compliance risk and lead to
anti-corruption violations and related enforcement actions. In addition, the Company has entered into and may continue to enter into agreements that provide its partners with exclusivity or other preemptive rights in agreed-upon geographic areas,
which may limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities in the manner that the Company desires. Generally, in the joint venture relationship, WeWork has undertaken not to operate its business in the specific region other than
through the party who has entered into an agreement with WeWork. These agreements also generally contain non-compete provisions whereby WeWork agrees not to compete with the counterparty in the applicable
region and agrees to provide an opportunity for the counterparty to participate in new ventures launched by WeWork in the applicable region. The
Company’s strategic business plan includes, among others optimization of our real estate portfolio and the development of a regional joint venture model, and any such optimization and joint venture efforts may not be successful. As part of the Company’s strategic plan, it intends to pursue growth through localized, market-driven models. In particular, the Company
intends to pursue regional joint venture arrangements in which the Company licenses, for a fee to an operator of flexible space in a location in which WeWork does not operate, the use of the WeWork technology and services for managing and powering
flexible work spaces and access to WeWork’s customer base. These business models are unproven and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Some of the counterparty risks the Company faces with respect to its members are heightened in the case of Enterprise Members. Enterprise Members, which often sign membership agreements with longer terms and for a greater number of memberships than other non-Enterprise members, accounted for 50%, 49%, 40% and 32% of the Company’s total membership and service revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Memberships attributable to Enterprise Members generally account for a high proportion of the Company’s revenue at a particular location, and some of its locations are occupied by just one Enterprise Member. In addition,
increasing Enterprise Members is a continuing part of the Company’s overall strategy. A default by an Enterprise Member under its agreement with the Company could cause a significant reduction in the operating cash flow generated by the
location where that Enterprise Member is situated. The Company would also incur certain costs following an unexpected vacancy by an Enterprise Member. Given the greater amount of space generally occupied by any Enterprise Member relative to the
Company’s other members, the time and effort required to execute a definitive agreement with an Enterprise Member is greater than the time and effort required to execute membership agreements with individuals or small- or mid-sized businesses, and accordingly, replacing an Enterprise Member after an unexpected vacancy by such Enterprise Member could 42 Table of Contents require a significant amount of the Company’s time, energy and resources. In addition, in some instances, the Company offers configured solutions that require it to customize the workspace
to the specific needs and brand aesthetics of the Enterprise Member, which may increase its build-out costs and its net capital expenditures per workstation added. If Enterprise Members were to delay
commencement of their membership agreements, fail to make membership fee payments when due, declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations to the Company, the Company may be forced to terminate their membership agreements with the
Company, which could result in sunk costs and transaction costs that are difficult or impossible for the Company to recover. The Company is exposed to
risks associated with the development and construction of the spaces it occupies. Opening new locations subjects the Company to risks
that are associated with development projects in general, such as delays in construction, contract disputes and claims, fines or penalties levied by government authorities relating to the Company’s construction activities, and reliance on third
parties for products used in the Company’s locations. The Company may also experience delays opening a new location as a result of delays by the building owners or landlords in completing their base building work or as a result of its inability
to obtain, or delays in its obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. The Company traditionally has sought to open new locations
on the first day of a month and delays, even if the delay only lasts a few days, can cause it to defer opening a new location by a full month. Failure to open a location on schedule may damage the Company’s reputation and brand and may also
cause it to incur expenses in order to rent and provide temporary space for its members or to provide those members with discounted membership fees. In developing its spaces, the Company generally relies on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of unaffiliated third-party
general contractors and subcontractors to perform the actual construction work and, in many cases, to select and obtain certain building materials, including in some cases from sole-source suppliers of such materials. As a result, the timing and
quality of the development of its occupied spaces depends on the performance of these third parties on the Company’s behalf. The
Company does not have long-term contractual commitments with general contractors, subcontractors or materials suppliers, except for pricing agreements with certain major materials suppliers. The prices the Company pays for the labor or materials
provided by these third parties, or other construction-related costs, could unexpectedly increase, which could have an adverse effect on the viability of the projects the Company pursues and on its results of operations and liquidity. Skilled
parties and high-quality materials may not continue to be available at reasonable rates in the markets in which the Company pursues its construction activities. In addition, the Company sources some of the products that it uses in its spaces from third-party suppliers. Although the Company tests the
products it purchases from these third-party suppliers, the Company may not be able to identify any or all defects associated with those products. If a member or other third party were to suffer an injury from the products the Company uses in its
space, the Company may suffer damage to its reputation, and may be exposed to possible liability. The people the Company engages in
connection with a construction project are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction project sites, which can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of
property, plant and equipment, and environmental damage. The Company’s insurance coverage may be inadequate in scope or coverage amount to fully compensate it for any losses it may incur arising from any such events at a construction site it
operates or oversees. In some cases, general contractors and their subcontractors may use improper construction practices or defective materials. Improper construction practices or defective materials can result in the need to perform extensive
repairs to the Company’s spaces, loss of revenue during the repairs and, potentially, personal injury or death. The Company also can suffer damage to its reputation, and may be exposed to possible liability, if these third parties fail to
comply with applicable laws. 43 Table of Contents The Company incurs costs relating to the maintenance, refurbishment and remediation of its spaces. The terms of its leases generally require that the Company ensure that the spaces it occupies are kept in good repair throughout the
term of the lease. The terms of its leases may also require that the Company remove certain fixtures and improvements to the space or return the space to the landlord at the end of the lease term in the same condition it was delivered to the
Company, which, in such instances, will require removing all fixtures and improvements to the space at the end of the lease term. The costs associated with this maintenance, removal and
