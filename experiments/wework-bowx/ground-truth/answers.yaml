      NOT DISCLOSED

      Inferrable: Physical memberships 517k (2019A) -> 380k (2020A) = -26% decline, but this conflates churn with COVID-driven demand collapse.

      Board claimed they were "qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective" based on their own "financial skills and background."

      LC Facility termination: February 10, 2023 (18 months post-deal)
      Red Flag: SoftBank NEEDED this SPAC deal to create exit liquidity for their $4B+ exposure. The LC facility expired Feb 2023 - without public listing or refinancing, WeWork collapses and SoftBank loses billions.

      "Any such event in the future may negatively impact the analysis regarding New WeWork's ability to continue as a going concern at such time."
      BowX's Own Cash Position (F-230): Cash in operating account $506,000, Working capital $(2.9M) deficit, 100% reliant on PIPE + redemption outcome.

      Critical Audit Matters: Impairment of Long-lived Assets ($1.142B impairment), Valuation of Equity Instruments ($419M in convertible liabilities).
      MISSING: Going Concern Paragraph - despite ~4 months runway, $224M/month burn, $36.6B lease obligations, $3.8B net loss (2020), ~$12.5B accumulated deficit, dependence on SoftBank.

      SoftBank controls 65.2% of voting power - absolute majority control.
      SBG (SoftBank Group): 364,289,126 shares (52.7%)
      SVFE (SoftBank Vision Fund): 81,029,831 shares (12.5%)
      SoftBank TOTAL: 445,318,957 shares (65.2%)
      Adam Neumann: 58,334,575 shares (9.0%)
      SoftBank + Neumann combined: 74.2% (supermajority)
      SoftBank can unilaterally: Elect all directors, approve any transaction, block any shareholder proposal, amend bylaws/charter.
      Red Flag: Public shareholders have NO meaningful governance voice. This is a controlled company in all but name.

      Different lock-up periods for different insiders - Neumann gets preferential treatment.
      Adam Neumann: 270 days (9 months)
      SoftBank (SBG + SVFE): 1 year
      Benchmark Capital: 1 year
      BowX Sponsor: 1 year
      Management: 1 year
      Early Release Triggers: BowX sponsors if stock hits $12 for 20/30 trading days after 150 days.
      Loopholes: Transfers to affiliates/funds/partners permitted, pledge arrangements for loans permitted, Neumann has special carve-out for existing pledge with StarBright WW LP, MFN clause.
      Red Flags: Neumann (fired founder) can sell 3 months before SoftBank. Pledge arrangements allow effective early monetization.

      Major shareholders have demand and piggyback registration rights - company pays all costs.
      SoftBank: 445.3M shares (65.2%) - Demand + Piggyback
      Adam Neumann: 58.3M shares (9.0%) - Demand + Piggyback
      Benchmark Capital: 19.5M shares (3.0%) - Demand + Piggyback
      BowX Sponsor: 4.9M shares (<1%) - Demand + Piggyback
      Management/Directors: Piggyback only
      Terms: Up to 3 demand registrations, company bears all costs, cut-back provisions if oversubscribed.
      Red Flag: Registration rights are the mechanism for SoftBank to convert 65% stake into cash. Cash-strapped WeWork pays for insider liquidity.

      WeWork claimed COVID accelerated flex-space demand, but their own numbers showed the opposite.
      Claims: "Multi trillion-dollar commercial real estate market", Flex space to reach 13.3%-22.2% of U.S. office by 2030, "COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to flexible workspace", ~23% market share in U.S./Canada, "57% of 2021 Fortune 100 companies were WeWork members"
      Contradictions: "COVID accelerated shift to flex" BUT Revenue DOWN 38.6%, "Proven business model through downturn" BUT Occupancy DOWN to 46%, "Maintained consistent revenue of $3.2B" BUT H1 2021 was collapsing
      Competition Section (Page 235): ONE paragraph, no named competitors, no mention of IWG/Regus (larger, profitable competitor) or Knotel (bankrupt Jan 2021).

      NO - Zero comparables, no valuation benchmarking.
      Not Provided: Fairness opinion, DCF analysis, comparable public companies, precedent transactions, EV/Revenue multiple justification, EV/EBITDA multiple justification.
      What Should Have Been Disclosed:
      Public Company Comparables: IWG plc (Regus) - Global flex space leader, 3,300+ locations, PROFITABLE; Servcorp - Premium serviced offices, PROFITABLE
      Precedent Transactions: Knotel bankruptcy (January 2021) - Flex-space competitor LIQUIDATED 9 months before deal; WeWork IPO (failed) September 2019 - Pulled at $47B, then $20B, then cancelled
      Red Flags: $8.8B deal with zero benchmarking. IWG not mentioned (comparison would show WeWork overvalued). Knotel bankruptcy completely ignored. Board self-certified as "qualified."

      NO CREDIBLE EXIT STRATEGY WAS DISCLOSED.
      SPAC Proceeds: PIPE Investment $800M + BowX Trust ~$333M = ~$1.13B total
      What $1.13B Covers: Monthly cash burn $224M (~5 months), Interest expense ~$300M/year (~3.8 months), CapEx ~$400M (<3 months)
      What $1.13B Does NOT Cover: Lease obligations $36.6B (32x proceeds), Near-term lease payments (2022) ~$3.5B (3x proceeds), SoftBank LC Facility maturity Feb 2023 (16 months away)
      Coverage ratio: $1.13B / $36.6B = 3.1%
      Stated "Strategy": Asset-light transition (minimal progress), Lease renegotiations (no specifics), Location closures (ongoing losses), Achieve profitability by 2022 (required 44%->86% occupancy)
      Red Flag: NO concrete plan for $36.6B structural mismatch. SPAC cash bought ~12-18 months runway, not a solution.

      MINIMAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES - same business model, same risks.
      What Changed: Legal structure (private->public NYSE:WE), Cash position ($855M -> ~$2B with SPAC)
      What Did NOT Change: Core structural mismatch (15-year leases vs 15-month memberships), Unit economics (still losing per member), SoftBank dependency, Governance (SoftBank 65% control), Cost structure (non-cancelable)
      "Turnaround" Plan: Occupancy improvement (required impossible 44%->86% jump), Cost cutting (already done $1.5B in 2020), Asset-light model (<5% were management agreements), Geographic focus (still 700+ locations globally)
      Red Flag: The SPAC was a LIQUIDITY EVENT, not a TRANSFORMATION. The fundamental business model that caused the 2019 IPO collapse remained intact.

      MULTIPLE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS with SoftBank holding significant control.
      2020 LC Facility: $1.7B outstanding, matures Feb 10, 2023, SBG is co-obligor
      Senior Unsecured Debt: $2.2B, direct SoftBank lending
      LC Debt Facility: $349M
      Senior Secured Notes: $1.1B available, collateralized by "substantially all assets"
      Covenant Structure: "Substantially all assets" pledged to SoftBank, restrictions on additional secured debt, change of control triggers, minimum liquidity requirements.
      If WeWork Defaults: SoftBank can accelerate all facilities, seize substantially all assets, LC letters of credit called, landlords draw on security, cross-default triggers.
      Circular Problem: WeWork needs cash -> Only SoftBank will lend -> SoftBank has $4B+ exposure -> Needs WeWork to survive -> WeWork survives only if SoftBank keeps lending
      Red Flag: WeWork was effectively a SoftBank subsidiary operating under the guise of a public company.

      UNAMBIGUOUS NO - This deal had fatal structural flaws visible in the filing.
      Summary of Fatal Flaws:
      Structural: $36.6B obligations vs $3B commitments (12:1 mismatch) - FATAL
      Financial: <4 months runway, negative unit economics - Critical
      Governance: No fairness opinion, no comparables, SoftBank 65% control - Critical
      Gatekeepers: Clean audit despite going concern risk, material weakness - High
      Management: $71M exec comp during cash crisis, Neumann retained 11% - High
      
      The Core Problem (from Page 34-35):
      "The average length of the initial term of its leases is approximately 15 years, and the average term of its membership agreements is 15 months."
      "Future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations... was $36.6 billion and committed sales contracts... totaled approximately $3 billion."
      
      Investment Thesis Required Believing:
      1. Occupancy would nearly double (44%->86%) in 2 years
      2. Landlords would renegotiate $36.6B in leases
      3. COVID would permanently accelerate flex-space demand (while revenue was -38.6%)
      4. Unit economics would flip positive despite no evidence
      5. SoftBank conflicts wouldn't harm public shareholders
      
      Verdict: Every piece of information needed to reject this deal was IN THE S-4 FILING. The fatal structural flaw was explicitly disclosed on pages 34-35. Investors who read the filing could have avoided 99.5% losses.
      
      Valuation History: Jan 2019 (SoftBank) $47B -> Sept 2019 (Failed IPO) $0 -> Oct 2019 (SoftBank bailout) $7B -> Oct 2021 (SPAC) $9B -> Nov 2023 (Bankruptcy) $45M (-99.5%)
