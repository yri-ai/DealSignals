**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
“Cash burn rate” generally refers to the rate at which a company consumes cash (typically negative free cash flow or net cash used in operating activities) over a given period, often expressed per month or per quarter. In the specific WeWork/BowX 2021 SPAC merger context, I don’t have reliable information about *the* cash burn rate figure (i.e., a specific numeric burn rate disclosed/used for that transaction) from my training data.
