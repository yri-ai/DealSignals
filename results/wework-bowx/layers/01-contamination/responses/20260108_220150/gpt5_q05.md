I don’t have reliable information about the **cash runway at the current burn rate** for WeWork around the **2021 BowX SPAC merger** from my training data. The runway would depend on a specific point-in-time cash balance and burn rate (which varied), and I don’t have a definitive figure to state without guessing.
