**1) Answer (based on training knowledge)**  
**Occupancy rate** (for WeWork) generally refers to the percentage of available desks/workstations or rentable capacity in its locations that are occupied by members/tenants (sometimes expressed as “desk occupancy” or “building/portfolio occupancy,” depending on the metric definition used in reporting).

**Trend (WeWork around the 2021 BowX SPAC period):** I don’t have reliable, specific occupancy-rate figures or a precise time series trend from the BowX merger materials in my training data. At a high level, WeWork’s occupancy was widely discussed as having **declined sharply during the COVID-19 period and then recovering gradually afterward**, but I can’t cite exact numbers or confirm the exact trajectory used in the BowX/WeWork 2021 disclosures.

**2) Confidence level:**  
- **Definition of occupancy rate:** **HIGH**  
- **How it has trended (specific to WeWork/BowX 2021):** **LOW**

**3) General knowledge vs. WeWork/BowX-specific:**  
- **Occupancy rate definition:** **General knowledge**  
- **Occupancy trend for the WeWork/BowX case:** **UNCERTAIN / not reliably known from training** ([UNCERTAIN])
