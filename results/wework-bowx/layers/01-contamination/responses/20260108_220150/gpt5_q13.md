**Answer:** *Total lease obligations* are the total payments a company is contractually required to make under its lease agreements over the remaining lease terms. They typically include future minimum lease payments (often shown as an undiscounted schedule by year) and, depending on the reporting context, may also be reflected on the balance sheet as a lease liability (the present value of those payments) under modern lease accounting (ASC 842 / IFRS 16).
