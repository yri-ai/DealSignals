I don’t have reliable information about the **duration profile of lease commitments** for WeWork in the context of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger (e.g., the specific maturity/tenor breakdown of lease obligations by year buckets) from my training data.

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, not general knowledge.
