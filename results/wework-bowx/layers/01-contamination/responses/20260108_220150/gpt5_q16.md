I don’t have reliable information about what specifically “happens to the business at 70% occupancy” in the context of the WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger materials (e.g., a stated break-even point, profitability threshold, or cash-flow inflection at 70% occupancy).

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Note:** This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (not general knowledge).
