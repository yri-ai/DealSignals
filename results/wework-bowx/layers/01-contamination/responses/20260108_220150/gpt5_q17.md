I don’t have reliable information about what specifically “happens to the business at 50% occupancy” in the context of the WeWork–BowX 2021 SPAC merger materials (e.g., whether this refers to break-even, profitability, cash burn, covenant issues, or a stated threshold in investor presentations).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, not general knowledge.
