1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
I don’t have reliable information about the specific valuation methodology BowX/WeWork used in 2021 to justify the transaction price (e.g., whether it was primarily a DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions, revenue multiple framework, or some combination) from my training data.

2) **Confidence level:** LOW

3) **General vs. WeWork/BowX-specific:** WeWork/BowX-specific (and I don’t have reliable WeWork/BowX-specific detail here)
