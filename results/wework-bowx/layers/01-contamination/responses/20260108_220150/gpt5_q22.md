1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
Before the merger, **SoftBank (via the SoftBank Vision Fund and related SoftBank entities) was WeWork’s controlling shareholder / largest backer**, holding a **majority ownership position** and significant influence over governance.  
After the merger (WeWork combining with BowX Acquisition Corp and listing publicly), **SoftBank remained the largest/controlling shareholder**, but its **ownership was diluted** by the transaction and the addition of new public shareholders (and PIPE/other transaction investors). SoftBank’s stake was still a large, influential position, but **reduced versus pre-merger**.

2) **Confidence level:** **MEDIUM** (I’m confident on “control/majority before” and “diluted but still largest after,” but not on precise percentages without looking them up.)

3) **Note:** **Specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (general concepts like dilution apply broadly, but the “SoftBank controlling before and still largest after” is case-specific).
