I don’t have reliable information about the specific **related-party transactions** disclosed in the **WeWork–BowX Acquisition Corp (2021) SPAC merger** materials from my training knowledge. **[LOW] [UNCERTAIN]**

General note (not specific to the WeWork/BowX case): in SPAC mergers, “related-party transactions” often include sponsor founder shares/promote, private placement warrants, advisory/financing fees to affiliates, PIPE allocations to affiliates, or arrangements involving major shareholders—but I cannot confirm which of these applied in the WeWork/BowX deal without the actual filings. **[MEDIUM] [TRAINING] (general knowledge, not WeWork/BowX-specific)**
