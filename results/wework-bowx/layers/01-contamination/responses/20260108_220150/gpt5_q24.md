**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
The parties that generally benefit most from the WeWork–BowX SPAC transaction closing are WeWork’s existing stakeholders—particularly its major backers (notably SoftBank as the dominant pre-transaction shareholder) and WeWork itself (via access to the merger consideration/cash on the balance sheet and becoming publicly traded). SPAC sponsors can also benefit via their promote economics, but I don’t have reliable, case-specific detail on who “most” benefited relative to each other in this exact transaction.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Note:** Mix of general SPAC/merger mechanics + partly specific to WeWork/BowX (SoftBank/WeWork positioning), but not fully certain on “most” benefited in a definitive, rank-ordered sense.
