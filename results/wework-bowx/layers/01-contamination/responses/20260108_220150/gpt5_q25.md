I don’t have reliable information about the **top 5 risk factors disclosed in the specific S‑4** for the **WeWork / BowX (2021)** transaction from my training data. **[LOW] [UNCERTAIN]**  
Reason: risk-factor sections in S‑4s are long, detailed, and transaction-specific, and I can’t accurately recall or verify which five were presented as the “top” items (or even whether the document explicitly ranked a “top 5”).

What I *can* say (as general knowledge, not a verified “top 5” list from that S‑4) is that SPAC merger S‑4 risk factors for a company like WeWork commonly emphasize areas such as: liquidity/going-concern risk, lease obligations and real-estate exposure, dependence on occupancy/member demand (including COVID impacts), related-party/governance and historical issues, and SPAC/redemption/financing/PIPE/closing-condition risks—but I cannot confirm these were the “top 5” as disclosed. **[LOW] [TRAINING — general pattern, not WeWork/BowX-specific]**
