WeWork’s 2021 SPAC merger materials and general public reporting emphasized that the business was dependent on a small number of senior leaders for strategy, turnaround execution, and stakeholder relationships. The key-person dependencies (at a high level) were:

- Dependence on WeWork’s top executive leadership team to execute the restructuring/turnaround plan and manage operations at scale (notably the CEO at the time, Sandeep Mathrani).
- Dependence on key finance/operating leaders to manage liquidity, forecasting, and lease/space optimization decisions (CFO/COO-type roles), given WeWork’s high fixed-commitment lease structure.
- Dependence on critical external relationship holders, especially those managing the SoftBank relationship and other major landlords/partners, since WeWork’s strategy and survival had been closely tied to negotiations and support from major counterparties.
- Residual “founder-related” dependency risk in perception/brand terms (historically associated with Adam Neumann), though by 2021 he was no longer running the company; the dependency in 2021 would primarily be on the new leadership team rather than him.

**Case specificity:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (framed at the level of what was commonly disclosed/understood), but expressed in generalized terms because I don’t have the exact wording from the BowX/WeWork proxy/registration statement in front of me.
