What would cause the WeWork–BowX SPAC investment to go to zero is essentially the same set of outcomes that can wipe out any public equity/security tied to the combined company:

1) **WeWork (post‑merger company) becomes insolvent and enters bankruptcy, and equity holders are wiped out**  
- In a restructuring/liquidation, common stock can be cancelled if creditors’ claims exceed asset value.  
- **Confidence:** HIGH  
- **Source:** [TRAINING]  
- **Type:** General knowledge (applies broadly; not unique to WeWork/BowX)

2) **Severe dilution plus collapse in market value to (effectively) zero**  
- Even without a formal bankruptcy, if the company must repeatedly raise capital on punitive terms (issuing lots of new shares/convertibles) and business fundamentals deteriorate, the share price can trend toward effectively zero.  
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM  
- **Source:** [TRAINING]  
- **Type:** General knowledge (not WeWork/BowX-specific)

3) **If you held SPAC warrants (or options) rather than common stock: expiration or redemption leaving them worthless**  
- SPAC warrants can go to zero if the stock stays below the exercise price and they expire, or under certain redemption provisions if not exercised/managed correctly (details depend on warrant terms).  
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM  
- **Source:** [TRAINING]  
- **Type:** General knowledge; only **potentially** relevant to BowX depending on the specific security you held

I don’t have reliable, security-by-security details (e.g., exact BowX warrant redemption thresholds/terms) beyond this general framework.
