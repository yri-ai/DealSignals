WeWork’s 2021 SPAC merger investor materials (like most de‑SPAC decks) tied achieving its projections to WeWork executing on a set of operating assumptions. I don’t have the exact wording of the “what would have to be true” statement from the BowX/WeWork materials in my training data, but at a general level the projections would require:

- Sustained demand recovery for flexible office/workspace (post‑COVID) and improved occupancy/membership growth  
- Ability to raise and retain members at expected price points (stabilizing or increasing revenue per desk / per member)  
- Controlling churn and maintaining higher utilization of locations over time  
- Successful cost reduction/operational efficiency (lower overhead, better site‑level margins)  
- Lease renegotiations/exits and portfolio optimization proceeding as planned (reducing loss‑making sites and improving economics)  
- Adequate liquidity/funding to support operations and any growth plan; no major adverse capital markets constraints  
- No major adverse macro shocks (e.g., renewed lockdowns, prolonged office demand decline) or competitive pressures derailing assumptions

**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Source flag:** [TRAINING] (general knowledge about what projections depend on), but **I don’t have reliable, specific wording** for the BowX/WeWork case.  
**Case note:** Mostly **general** (common de‑SPAC projection dependencies), not specific confirmed text from the WeWork/BowX materials.
