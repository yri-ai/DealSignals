**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
The strongest argument commonly cited for the WeWork–BowX SPAC deal was that it provided **a large, committed capital raise (via PIPE + cash in trust)** to **strengthen WeWork’s balance sheet and fund its turnaround** under new management—improving liquidity after the failed 2019 IPO and positioning the company to pursue a more disciplined, asset-light “flexible workspace” strategy as demand patterns shifted (including hybrid work trends).
