**Answer (based on training knowledge):** The strongest argument against the WeWork–BowX SPAC deal was that WeWork still had deeply challenged unit economics and an unproven path to sustainable profitability/cash flow, combined with significant uncertainty about post‑COVID office demand. Critics argued the transaction valuation and forward projections relied heavily on an optimistic recovery and growth assumptions while the business remained highly cash‑consumptive with sizable lease obligations.
