  "content": "1) **Answer (questions to ask management before deciding)** [HIGH] [TRAINING]  \nThese are the key diligence questions I would ask WeWork and BowX management (and the combined-company leadership) before deciding whether the merger/investment thesis is sound:\n\n**A. Demand, retention, and unit economics**\n- What are occupancy trends by market and by building cohort (pre\u2011COVID vs newer locations)? What assumptions are you using for stabilization?\n- What are retention/churn rates for key customer segments (enterprise vs SMB), and how have they changed post\u20112020?\n- What is the contribution margin at the location level (by vintage and market), and what is required (occupancy/pricing) for a typical site to reach break-even?\n- How much of revenue is recurring vs short-term; what is average membership term and the renewal profile?\n\n**B. Pricing power and competition**\n- What pricing strategy and discounting levels are assumed in the forecast? What evidence supports pricing power vs competitors and traditional landlords?\n- How sensitive is demand to price in top markets? What\u2019s the plan if hybrid work reduces peak demand?\n\n**C. Lease obligations, balance-sheet risk, and downside protection**\n- What is the full maturity profile of lease commitments and other fixed obligations, and how do you stress-test them under lower occupancy scenarios?\n- What renegotiation or restructuring options exist with landlords if occupancy weakens? What\u2019s the track record to date?\n- What is the cash burn profile under base/downside cases, and what liquidity runway exists post-transaction?\n\n**D. Path to profitability**\n- What specific actions drive EBITDA and free cash flow improvement (cost cuts, lease renegotiations, pricing, occupancy), and what milestones/timing?\n- What are the biggest uncertainties in the plan to reach sustained positive cash flow, and what leading indicators do you track monthly?\n\n**E. Corporate governance and controls**\n- What governance changes were made after prior issues (internal controls, related-party oversight, executive accountability)?\n- How is management compensation structured (metrics, time horizon), and does it align with long-term profitability and cash generation?\n\n**F. Transaction structure, valuation, and dilution**\n- What are the key terms of the SPAC deal that affect dilution (PIPE size/terms, earnouts, sponsor promote), and how sensitive are outcomes to redemptions?\n- Why is this valuation justified relative to realistic forward cash flows and risk? What comps or alternative valuation frameworks are you using?\n\n**G. Forecast credibility and KPI transparency**\n- Which KPIs best predict future performance (e.g., committed occupancy, lead-to-member conversion, enterprise pipeline), and will you report them consistently?\n- What assumptions are embedded in projections (market growth, pricing, churn, capex), and how did you validate them with third-party data?\n\n**H. Strategy and operational focus**\n- What is the strategy regarding footprint: growth vs consolidation, and what criteria determine opening/closing locations?\n- How will WeWork prioritize enterprise clients vs smaller members, and what does that imply for margins and volatility?\n- What is the plan for capital-light models (management agreements/franchising) versus long-term leases?\n\n2) **Confidence level:** **HIGH**  \n3) **Note:** **General knowledge** (this is a standard pre-investment/merger diligence question set applied to the WeWork/BowX situation, not specific undisclosed facts about the case).",
