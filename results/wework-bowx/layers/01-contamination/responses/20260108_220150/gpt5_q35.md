1) **Answer (questions to ask management before deciding)** [HIGH] [TRAINING]  
These are the key diligence questions I would ask WeWork and BowX management (and the combined-company leadership) before deciding whether the merger/investment thesis is sound:

**A. Demand, retention, and unit economics**
- What are occupancy trends by market and by building cohort (pre‑COVID vs newer locations)? What assumptions are you using for stabilization?
- What are retention/churn rates for key customer segments (enterprise vs SMB), and how have they changed post‑2020?
- What is the contribution margin at the location level (by vintage and market), and what is required (occupancy/pricing) for a typical site to reach break-even?
- How much of revenue is recurring vs short-term; what is average membership term and the renewal profile?

**B. Pricing power and competition**
- What pricing strategy and discounting levels are assumed in the forecast? What evidence supports pricing power vs competitors and traditional landlords?
- How sensitive is demand to price in top markets? What’s the plan if hybrid work reduces peak demand?

**C. Lease obligations, balance-sheet risk, and downside protection**
- What is the full maturity profile of lease commitments and other fixed obligations, and how do you stress-test them under lower occupancy scenarios?
- What renegotiation or restructuring options exist with landlords if occupancy weakens? What’s the track record to date?
- What is the cash burn profile under base/downside cases, and what liquidity runway exists post-transaction?

**D. Path to profitability**
- What specific actions drive EBITDA and free cash flow improvement (cost cuts, lease renegotiations, pricing, occupancy), and what milestones/timing?
- What are the biggest uncertainties in the plan to reach sustained positive cash flow, and what leading indicators do you track monthly?

**E. Corporate governance and controls**
- What governance changes were made after prior issues (internal controls, related-party oversight, executive accountability)?
- How is management compensation structured (metrics, time horizon), and does it align with long-term profitability and cash generation?

**F. Transaction structure, valuation, and dilution**
- What are the key terms of the SPAC deal that affect dilution (PIPE size/terms, earnouts, sponsor promote), and how sensitive are outcomes to redemptions?
- Why is this valuation justified relative to realistic forward cash flows and risk? What comps or alternative valuation frameworks are you using?

**G. Forecast credibility and KPI transparency**
- Which KPIs best predict future performance (e.g., committed occupancy, lead-to-member conversion, enterprise pipeline), and will you report them consistently?
- What assumptions are embedded in projections (market growth, pricing, churn, capex), and how did you validate them with third-party data?

**H. Strategy and operational focus**
- What is the strategy regarding footprint: growth vs consolidation, and what criteria determine opening/closing locations?
- How will WeWork prioritize enterprise clients vs smaller members, and what does that imply for margins and volatility?
- What is the plan for capital-light models (management agreements/franchising) versus long-term leases?

2) **Confidence level:** **HIGH**  
3) **Note:** **General knowledge** (this is a standard pre-investment/merger diligence question set applied to the WeWork/BowX situation, not specific undisclosed facts about the case).
