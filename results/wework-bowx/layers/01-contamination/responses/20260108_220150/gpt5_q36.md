I don’t have reliable information about WeWork’s specific market share in flexible workspace.

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This would be **specific** (it depends on how “flexible workspace” is defined—global vs. regional, revenue vs. desks/seats, time period, inclusion of serviced offices/coworking), and I don’t have a verified figure in my training knowledge.
