Adam Neumann did **not** have an ongoing management or governance role at WeWork at the time of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger announcement/closing. He had stepped down earlier (2019) and was no longer CEO or chairman. However, he remained **financially involved** as a **significant shareholder** and was party to arrangements in which WeWork/SoftBank-related entities **bought out or reduced** portions of his stake and addressed certain obligations connected to his departure; he was not expected to return to run the company.
