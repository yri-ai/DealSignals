For accurate, current financial information, you would need to consult:\n- WeWork's SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q reports)\n- The company's investor relations materials\n- Financial databases like Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, or FactSet\n\n**Note:** If you're testing my knowledge against a specific document you have, I should clarify that I'm working only from general training knowledge, not from any specific filing or the SEC S-4 document from the BowX merger.",
