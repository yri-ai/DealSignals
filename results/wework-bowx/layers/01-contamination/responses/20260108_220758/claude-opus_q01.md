**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's "most recent" reported period, as that depends on when you're asking this question and my training data has a knowledge cutoff.

**What I can provide from training knowledge:**

From the period around the SPAC merger (2021), WeWork reported:
- **2020 full-year revenue:** Approximately $3.2 billion
- **2021 revenue (around merger time):** The company was projecting/reporting revenues in the range of $3+ billion annually

However, I cannot give you a confident "most recent" figure because:
1. My training data has a cutoff date
2. WeWork's financial situation changed significantly post-merger
3. The company filed for bankruptcy in November 2023, which would have affected reporting

**Confidence:** [LOW] - [UNCERTAIN]

The specific revenue figures I mentioned are approximate recollections from training data. For accurate, current financial information, you would need to consult:
- WeWork's SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q reports)
- The company's investor relations materials
- Financial databases like Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, or FactSet

**Note:** If you're testing my knowledge against a specific document you have, I should clarify that I'm working only from general training knowledge, not from any specific filing or the SEC S-4 document from the BowX merger.
