**Answer:** I don't have reliable specific information about WeWork's exact year-over-year revenue growth rate at the time of the BowX SPAC merger.

**What I do recall [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]:**
- WeWork's revenue had been growing significantly in the years leading up to 2019 (pre-pandemic), with the company reporting rapid membership and location expansion
- The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 significantly impacted WeWork's business, likely causing revenue declines or stagnation as office demand dropped
- By 2021 when the SPAC merger was announced, there was discussion of recovery trajectories

**What I cannot reliably state:**
- The precise YoY percentage growth rate cited in the merger documents
- Whether the specific period in question showed growth or decline
- The exact figures from their S-4 or investor presentations

**[LOW confidence]** I have a vague recollection that projections at the time of the merger showed expectations for significant future revenue growth (potentially 30-50%+ projected), but I cannot confirm the actual historical YoY rate with accuracy.

**Recommendation:** For accurate revenue growth figures, you would need to reference the actual BowX/WeWork merger investor presentation or SEC filings from 2021.
