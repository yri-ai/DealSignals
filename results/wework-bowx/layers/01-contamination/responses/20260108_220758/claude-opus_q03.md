Based on my training knowledge regarding WeWork's financial situation around the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021:

**Answer:** WeWork reported significant operating losses. For the first half of 2021 (the period most relevant to the SPAC merger discussions), WeWork's operating losses were approximately **$1.5-2 billion** on an annualized basis. The company had historically reported massive operating losses - in 2020, operating losses were around **$3.2 billion**, which represented an improvement from 2019's approximately **$3.5 billion** operating loss.

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is based on widely reported financial information from WeWork's SPAC merger filings and news coverage that was part of my training data.

**Important caveat:** I don't have precise figures for the exact period that might be considered "most recent" relative to the merger closing (October 2021). The specific numbers could vary depending on which reporting period you're referring to, and I may not have the most precise quarterly breakdown. If you need exact figures, I'd recommend consulting the actual S-4 filing or WeWork's 10-Q/10-K reports filed with the SEC.
