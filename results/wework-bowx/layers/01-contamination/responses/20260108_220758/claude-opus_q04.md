Based on my training knowledge about WeWork around the time of the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** WeWork had a significant cash burn rate, which was one of the major concerns for investors. From my training data, WeWork was burning approximately **$500 million to $700+ million per quarter** in the period leading up to and around the SPAC merger. The company had historically been known for extremely high operating losses, with cash burn that had at times exceeded $1 billion per quarter in earlier periods (2019).

By the time of the 2021 SPAC merger, WeWork had reduced its cash burn compared to its peak (pre-failed 2019 IPO), but it remained substantial - likely in the range of **$400-600 million per quarter** as the company was still operating at a significant loss while trying to reach profitability.

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is based on general knowledge about WeWork's well-documented financial challenges from news coverage and financial reporting around this period.

**Important caveat:** I don't have precise, specific figures from the actual BowX merger documents or WeWork's exact quarterly reports at the time of the merger. The cash burn rate varied quarter to quarter based on restructuring efforts, COVID impacts, and real estate adjustments. The exact figure disclosed in the SPAC merger materials may differ from these general ranges I'm citing from broader coverage.
