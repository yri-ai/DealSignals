**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific cash runway at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**Explanation:** Cash runway calculations require knowing:
1. The specific cash/liquidity position at a given point in time
2. The burn rate at that same time period

While I have general knowledge that WeWork was burning significant cash (reportedly $100M+ per month in some periods leading up to and during 2021), I don't have precise figures from the BowX merger documentation that would allow me to accurately state the cash runway.

What I can say with MEDIUM confidence [TRAINING]:
- WeWork had substantial ongoing operating losses at the time of the SPAC merger
- The SPAC transaction was partly motivated by WeWork's need for additional capital
- The merger was expected to provide approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds (though this figure may have varied based on redemptions)

If you need the specific cash runway figure, I'd recommend consulting the S-4 registration statement or investor presentation from the BowX/WeWork merger, which would have detailed projections.
