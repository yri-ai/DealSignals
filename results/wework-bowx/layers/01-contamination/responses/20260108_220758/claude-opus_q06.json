  "content": "Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about WeWork's stated path to profitability around the time of the BowX SPAC merger.\n\n## Answer\n\n**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**\n\nWeWork projected reaching **Adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of 2021 or early 2022**, with a path to GAAP profitability following thereafter. The key elements of their stated path to profitability included:\n\n1. **Cost restructuring** - Significant cuts made during 2020, including exiting unprofitable locations and reducing headcount\n\n2. **Improved unit economics** - Focus on mature buildings with higher occupancy rates generating positive contribution margins\n\n3. **Flexible space demand growth** - Projections that hybrid/flexible work trends post-COVID would accelerate enterprise demand\n\n4. **Asset-light expansion** - Shifting toward management agreements and franchising rather than capital-intensive direct leases\n\n**Important caveats:**\n- I don't have precise recall of the specific timeline targets stated in the SPAC investor presentation\n- The exact GAAP profitability target year (I believe they projected somewhere around 2024-2025, but I'm less certain on this)\n- These were forward-looking projections that carried significant execution risk\n\n**What I'm less certain about:**\nThe specific revenue and EBITDA figures projected for each year in their investor materials. I would not want to quote specific numbers without higher confidence.\n\n*Note: WeWork ultimately filed for bankruptcy in November 2023, so these projections did not materialize as presented.*",
