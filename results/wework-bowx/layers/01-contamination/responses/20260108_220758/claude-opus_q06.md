Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about WeWork's stated path to profitability around the time of the BowX SPAC merger.

## Answer

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

WeWork projected reaching **Adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of 2021 or early 2022**, with a path to GAAP profitability following thereafter. The key elements of their stated path to profitability included:

1. **Cost restructuring** - Significant cuts made during 2020, including exiting unprofitable locations and reducing headcount

2. **Improved unit economics** - Focus on mature buildings with higher occupancy rates generating positive contribution margins

3. **Flexible space demand growth** - Projections that hybrid/flexible work trends post-COVID would accelerate enterprise demand

4. **Asset-light expansion** - Shifting toward management agreements and franchising rather than capital-intensive direct leases

**Important caveats:**
- I don't have precise recall of the specific timeline targets stated in the SPAC investor presentation
- The exact GAAP profitability target year (I believe they projected somewhere around 2024-2025, but I'm less certain on this)
- These were forward-looking projections that carried significant execution risk

**What I'm less certain about:**
The specific revenue and EBITDA figures projected for each year in their investor materials. I would not want to quote specific numbers without higher confidence.

*Note: WeWork ultimately filed for bankruptcy in November 2023, so these projections did not materialize as presented.*
