# Key Assumptions Underlying WeWork/BowX SPAC Projections

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC merger and typical SPAC projection frameworks, here are the key assumptions that were disclosed:

## Revenue & Growth Assumptions
- **Aggressive membership growth** projections, assuming accelerating demand for flexible workspace post-pandemic
- **Occupancy rate improvements** - projections assumed recovery to pre-pandemic levels and beyond
- **Revenue per member** assumptions based on pricing stabilization

## Operational Assumptions
- **Path to profitability** through cost-cutting measures already underway under Sandeep Mathrani's leadership
- **Reduced location count** - assumed continued rationalization of the real estate portfolio
- **Improved unit economics** at mature locations

## Market Assumptions
- **Hybrid work trend** driving demand for flexible office space
- **Enterprise customer mix** shifting higher (more stable, higher-margin clients)
- **Geographic recovery** assumptions for key markets

## What I'm Less Certain About

**[UNCERTAIN]** I do not have reliable information about:
- The specific numerical targets (exact revenue figures, EBITDA projections by year)
- The precise discount rates or terminal value assumptions used
- Detailed breakdown of assumptions by geographic segment

The projections were widely criticized as overly optimistic at the time, which was common for SPAC transactions in that era. If you need specific numbers or detailed assumption breakdowns, I'd recommend reviewing the actual S-4/proxy filing.
