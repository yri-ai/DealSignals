**Explanation:** "Contribution margin per membership" is a specific operational/financial metric that WeWork would have reported in their investor presentations, S-4 filings, or earnings materials related to the BowX SPAC merger. While I have general knowledge that WeWork tracked unit economics metrics like this as they tried to demonstrate a path to profitability during the SPAC process, I do not have reliable recall of the specific dollar figures or percentages they disclosed for contribution margin per membership.

This type of granular financial metric would require me to reference the actual merger documents, investor presentations, or SEC filings from 2021, and I cannot confidently cite those specific numbers from my training data.

If you need this figure, I would recommend checking:
- The WeWork/BowX investor presentation (typically released at merger announcement)
- The S-4/DEFM14A proxy filings with the SEC
- WeWork's subsequent 10-K or 10-Q filings after going public
