I need to clarify what you're asking about, as this could be interpreted two ways:

---

## If asking about the **general metric definition:**

**[HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]**

Revenue per available desk/workstation is a key performance indicator (KPI) in the flexible workspace/coworking industry. It measures:

**Revenue per Available Desk = Total Revenue ÷ Total Available Desks/Workstations**

This metric helps assess:
- Pricing efficiency
- Space monetization
- Operational performance relative to capacity

It's distinct from revenue per *occupied* desk, which measures only filled capacity.

---

## If asking about **WeWork's specific figures** for this metric:

**I don't have reliable information about this.**

While I know WeWork disclosed various operational metrics in their SPAC merger materials, I don't have confident recall of their specific revenue-per-desk figures from the BowX merger documentation. I would not want to cite a number that could be inaccurate.

---

**Would you like me to discuss:**
1. How this metric is typically calculated and used in the industry?
2. What other metrics WeWork emphasized in their investor presentations (if I have reliable recall)?
