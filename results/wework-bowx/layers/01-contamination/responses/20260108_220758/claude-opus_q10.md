# Occupancy Rate Analysis for WeWork

## Definition
**Occupancy rate** measures the percentage of WeWork's available desk/workstation capacity that is actually filled by paying members. It's calculated as:

*Occupancy Rate = Filled Workstations / Total Available Workstations*

This is a critical KPI for WeWork's business model since their costs are largely fixed (leases) while revenue scales with occupancy.

## Historical Trend [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

Based on my training knowledge:

**Pre-Pandemic (2019):**
- Occupancy was in the **mid-to-high 70% range** in mature markets
- Newer locations typically took 12-18 months to reach stabilized occupancy

**COVID Impact (2020):**
- Occupancy dropped significantly as offices emptied
- Fell to approximately **50-60% range** at the low point
- This was devastating given WeWork's fixed lease obligations

**Recovery Period (2021 - around SPAC merger):**
- Occupancy was recovering but had not returned to pre-pandemic levels
- I recall figures in the **~60-65% range** being discussed around the BowX merger timeframe
- Management projected continued improvement

## Important Context

WeWork's business model requires high occupancy (generally 70%+) to approach profitability due to the spread between their lease costs and membership revenue.

**Caveat:** [UNCERTAIN] I don't have high confidence in the precise percentage figures. The general trend (decline then recovery) I'm confident about, but specific occupancy numbers from the SPAC filings would need verification against the actual S-4 documents.
