**Answer:** Member churn rate refers to the percentage of members (customers/tenants) who leave or cancel their memberships within a given time period. In the context of a flexible workspace company like WeWork, this would measure the rate at which members do not renew their desk, office, or workspace agreements.

**Formula:** Typically calculated as:
- (Members lost during period / Total members at start of period) × 100

**Why it matters:** For membership-based business models like WeWork's, churn rate is a critical metric because:
- It directly impacts revenue predictability
- High churn increases customer acquisition costs
- It affects occupancy rates and utilization of real estate
- Investors use it to assess business sustainability and "stickiness" of the revenue model

**Note:** While I understand the general concept of member churn rate, I don't have reliable specific information about what WeWork's actual churn rates were at the time of the BowX SPAC merger, or what specific churn projections were included in their investor presentations. If you need those specific figures, I would recommend consulting the actual merger documents or investor presentations from that transaction.
