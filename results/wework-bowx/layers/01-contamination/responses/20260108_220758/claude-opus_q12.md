**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific average revenue per member figure.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**Explanation:** While I have general knowledge about WeWork's business model and the BowX SPAC merger from 2021, I don't have confident recall of the specific "average revenue per member" metric. This is a granular operational KPI that would have been disclosed in investor presentations or SEC filings related to the merger.

What I can say with more confidence is that WeWork's revenue model was based on membership fees that varied significantly by:
- Location/market (Manhattan vs. secondary markets)
- Type of membership (hot desk vs. dedicated desk vs. private office)
- Enterprise vs. individual members

The average revenue per member would have been a blended figure across these categories, and I believe it was discussed in the SPAC presentation materials, but I cannot reliably quote the specific number without risking providing inaccurate information.

If you have access to the BowX/WeWork investor presentation or S-4 filing, that would contain the authoritative figure for this metric.
