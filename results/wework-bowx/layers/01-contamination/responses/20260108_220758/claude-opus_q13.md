Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's financial situation around the time of the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** I don't have reliable specific figures for WeWork's total lease obligations at the time of the SPAC merger that I can cite with confidence.

**What I do know [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]:**
- WeWork's lease obligations were extraordinarily large - this was one of the central concerns about the company's business model
- The company had long-term lease commitments spanning 15-20 years in many cases
- Lease obligations were a major factor in the company's financial distress and the failed 2019 IPO
- By the time of the 2021 SPAC merger, WeWork had been working to renegotiate and reduce its lease footprint following the 2019 collapse

**General context [HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]:**
- At its peak, WeWork's lease liabilities were estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars
- The mismatch between long-term lease obligations and short-term (often month-to-month) member agreements was a fundamental business model risk that analysts frequently highlighted

**What I cannot reliably provide:**
- The exact dollar figure for total lease obligations as disclosed in the SPAC merger proxy/S-4 filing
- The precise breakdown between operating and finance leases at that specific point

If you need the specific figure from the BowX merger documents, I would recommend consulting the actual SEC filings (Form S-4 or proxy statement) rather than relying on my potentially imprecise recollection.
