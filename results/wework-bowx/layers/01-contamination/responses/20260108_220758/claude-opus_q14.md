Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model and the information that would have been disclosed during the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

WeWork's lease commitments were characterized by a significant **duration mismatch** that was a core risk factor in their business model:

- **WeWork's lease obligations:** Typically **long-term**, often ranging from **10-15 years** with landlords
- **WeWork's member agreements:** Typically **short-term**, often **month-to-month or 1-2 years** with their customers

This duration mismatch meant WeWork had long-dated fixed obligations while revenue was subject to shorter-term variability. At the time of the SPAC merger discussions (2021), WeWork had **tens of billions of dollars** in future minimum lease payment obligations extending over many years.

**What I'm less certain about:**

I don't have reliable information about the *exact* breakdown of lease maturities by year or the precise weighted-average lease term as disclosed in the specific BowX merger proxy materials. The detailed schedule of lease commitments by fiscal year would have been in the SEC filings, but I cannot quote those specific figures with confidence.

**Key caveat:** The specific quantitative duration profile (e.g., "$X billion due in years 1-5, $Y billion in years 6-10") would require the actual merger documents, which I cannot reliably reproduce in detail.
