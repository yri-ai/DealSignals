Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about WeWork's lease arrangements, though with important caveats:

## Answer

**[LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]**

I don't have reliable, specific information about the detailed lease termination provisions in WeWork's lease agreements as they were disclosed in the BowX SPAC merger documents.

### What I Know Generally:

WeWork's business model involved signing **long-term master leases** with landlords (typically 10-15 years) while offering **shorter-term, flexible arrangements** to members/tenants. This created a well-documented liability mismatch that was a significant risk factor.

### General Lease Termination Elements Typically Disclosed:

- Early termination penalties/fees
- Notice period requirements
- Conditions allowing termination (e.g., co-tenancy clauses, performance thresholds)
- Landlord cure rights
- Assignment/sublease restrictions

### Why I'm Uncertain:

The **specific termination provisions** would vary by:
- Individual lease agreements
- Jurisdiction
- Landlord negotiations
- Building type

The SPAC proxy/S-4 would have disclosed **aggregate lease obligations** and **material lease terms**, but I don't have reliable recall of those specific figures or provisions from the 2021 filing.

**I recommend reviewing the S-4/Proxy Statement's sections on "Commitments and Contingencies" and lease-related risk factors for authoritative details.**
