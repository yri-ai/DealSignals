Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model and the SPAC merger context:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

At approximately 70% occupancy, WeWork's locations were generally expected to reach **breakeven or profitability at the individual location level**. This was a critical threshold in WeWork's unit economics discussions.

The logic was:
- Below 70% occupancy: Locations typically operated at a loss due to fixed costs (lease obligations, buildout amortization, staff, utilities)
- At/above 70%: Incremental members contributed more significantly to margin since fixed costs were already covered

This 70% figure was frequently cited in WeWork's investor materials and analyst discussions around the time of the BowX merger as a key metric for understanding when their "mature" locations would generate positive contribution margin.

**Important caveat:** I'm less certain about whether this specific 70% threshold was formally stated in the BowX merger proxy materials versus being a general industry/analyst benchmark for WeWork. The exact breakeven point could vary by market, location size, and membership mix.

If you need the precise language from the S-4 or investor presentation, I'd recommend verifying against the actual documents, as my recollection of specific document details is less reliable than the general business model concept.
