Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model and the SPAC merger context:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

At approximately 50% occupancy, WeWork's locations were generally operating at or near **breakeven** on a contribution margin basis. This was a critical threshold for the company because:

1. **Below 50% occupancy**: Locations typically operated at a loss, as fixed costs (rent, utilities, staff) weren't adequately covered by membership revenue

2. **Above 50% occupancy**: Locations could generate positive contribution margins, with profitability improving significantly as occupancy increased toward 70-80%+

This occupancy dynamic was central to WeWork's path-to-profitability narrative during the BowX merger discussions. The company emphasized that maturing locations (those open 18+ months) had higher occupancy rates and better unit economics, while newer locations dragged down overall metrics as they ramped up.

**Important caveat:** The specific 50% breakeven figure is my general understanding from WeWork's business model discussions around that period. The exact breakeven occupancy rate could vary by location, market, and cost structure. I don't have precise figures from the actual BowX investor presentation in front of me, so the specific threshold mentioned in their projections may have been stated differently.

If you need the exact figure from the merger documents, I'd recommend verifying against the actual investor presentation.
