Based on my training knowledge:

The implied enterprise value for WeWork in the BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger was approximately **$9 billion**.

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING]

**Context:** This represented a significant reduction from WeWork's peak private valuation of $47 billion in 2019, before the failed IPO attempt. The $9 billion enterprise value reflected the company's revised positioning and the more sobering market assessment of its business model following the 2019 implosion.

I should note that while I recall this figure being widely reported at the time of the merger announcement in early 2021, the exact final enterprise value may have had slight adjustments based on deal mechanics (PIPE investment, redemptions, etc.). The $9 billion figure was the headline number from the initial announcement.
