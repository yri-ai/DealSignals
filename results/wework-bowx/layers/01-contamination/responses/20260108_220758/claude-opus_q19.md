Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

The valuation methodology used to justify the ~$9 billion enterprise value in the WeWork SPAC deal primarily relied on:

1. **Revenue Multiples** - The deal was justified using forward revenue multiples, comparing WeWork's projected future revenues against comparable flexible workspace and real estate technology companies.

2. **Projected Growth Metrics** - Heavy emphasis was placed on forward-looking projections, including anticipated revenue growth as the company emerged from pandemic-related disruptions and implemented its restructuring under CEO Sandeep Mathrani.

3. **Path to Profitability Analysis** - The SPAC presentation emphasized WeWork's claimed trajectory toward adjusted EBITDA profitability, which was used to justify the valuation despite ongoing operating losses.

**Important Caveats:**
- The $9 billion valuation was a dramatic discount from the ~$47 billion valuation in the failed 2019 IPO attempt
- SPAC mergers in this era were criticized broadly for relying heavily on optimistic forward projections rather than traditional DCF or comparable transaction analyses
- The specific detailed methodology from the proxy materials I cannot recall with precision

**What I'm less certain about:** The exact comparable companies used, specific multiple ranges cited, or detailed assumptions in the investor presentation. If you need those specifics, I'd recommend reviewing the actual merger proxy/S-4 filing.
