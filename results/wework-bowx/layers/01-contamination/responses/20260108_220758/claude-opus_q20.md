Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger:

## Comparable Transactions and Companies Cited

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

From what I recall about the WeWork SPAC deal context and typical flexible workspace/proptech comparisons at that time:

**Likely Comparable Companies:**
- **IWG plc (Regus)** - The most direct public competitor in flexible workspace
- **Industrious** - Private competitor in premium flexible office space
- **Knotel** - Flexible workspace provider (though it filed for bankruptcy in early 2021)

**Potential SPAC Transaction Comparables:**
- Other high-profile de-SPAC transactions from 2020-2021 were likely referenced, though I'm less certain which specific ones were cited in the investor presentation

**Caveat:** I don't have reliable, specific information about exactly which comparable transactions were formally cited in the BowX/WeWork investor presentation or proxy materials. The specific comparables used in valuation analysis (whether trading comps, transaction comps, or DCF assumptions) would be detailed in the merger documentation, which I cannot recall with precision.

**What I'm uncertain about:**
- The exact EV/Revenue or other multiples cited
- Whether they used "sum-of-the-parts" analysis with different segments
- Specific SPAC deals cited as transaction precedents

If you need the precise comparable set from the investor presentation, I would recommend reviewing the actual SPAC merger presentation filed with the SEC.
