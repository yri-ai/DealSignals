## Answer: PIPE Terms and Investors for WeWork-BowX Merger

**Confidence: [MEDIUM] - [TRAINING]**

### What I know from training:

**PIPE Investment Size:**
- The PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) was approximately **$800 million**

**Key Investors:**
- **Insight Partners** - was reported as a significant participant
- **Starwood Capital Group** - Barry Sternlicht's firm was involved (notably, Sternlicht was BowX's sponsor)
- **Fidelity Management** - reported as a PIPE investor
- **Various institutional investors** participated

**Terms:**
- Standard PIPE structure at $10 per share (typical for SPAC transactions)

### What I'm less certain about:

- The exact breakdown of how much each investor committed
- The complete list of all PIPE participants
- Whether there were any special terms or side agreements for particular investors
- The final PIPE size at closing (these sometimes change between announcement and completion)

### Caveat:

I don't have reliable information about the full investor roster or detailed PIPE terms beyond these high-level points. PIPE investor lists are sometimes disclosed in SEC filings but I may not have complete details from my training data. For precise figures and the complete investor list, I'd recommend checking the SEC Form S-4 or proxy statement filed for the transaction.
