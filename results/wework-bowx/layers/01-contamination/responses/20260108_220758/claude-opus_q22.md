# SoftBank's Position in WeWork - Before and After the BowX Merger

**Confidence: [HIGH]** | **Source: [TRAINING]**

## Before the Merger

SoftBank was WeWork's largest investor and most significant backer:

- **Massive Investment:** SoftBank (through its Vision Fund and directly) had invested approximately **$10-11 billion** in WeWork over multiple funding rounds
- **Failed 2019 IPO Rescue:** After WeWork's original IPO collapsed in 2019, SoftBank provided an additional bailout/rescue financing package
- **Control Position:** SoftBank held substantial voting power and board representation
- **Write-downs:** SoftBank had already taken significant write-downs on its WeWork investment by 2021

## After the BowX SPAC Merger

- **Remained Largest Shareholder:** SoftBank continued as the dominant shareholder post-merger, though with a diluted percentage
- **Ownership Stake:** SoftBank retained approximately **~29%** of the combined company (I have medium confidence on this specific percentage)
- **Continued Board Presence:** Maintained significant governance influence
- **Paper Losses Crystallized:** The SPAC valuation of ~$9 billion was far below WeWork's peak private valuation of $47 billion, representing substantial losses for SoftBank

## Key Context

SoftBank's position was notable because they were effectively "trapped" - they had invested too much to walk away but the investment represented one of the Vision Fund's most troubled bets.
