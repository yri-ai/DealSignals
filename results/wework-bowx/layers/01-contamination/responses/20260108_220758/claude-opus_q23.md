## Related-Party Transactions in WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge, I can identify several categories of related-party transactions that were disclosed in connection with the WeWork SPAC merger:

### Known Related-Party Transactions:

1. **SoftBank Relationships**
   - SoftBank was both a major WeWork shareholder and had various financing arrangements
   - SoftBank provided credit facilities and had made prior equity investments
   - Complex intercompany relationships between SoftBank entities and WeWork

2. **Adam Neumann Legacy Arrangements**
   - Although Neumann had stepped down as CEO, there were residual related-party matters from his tenure
   - Historical building lease arrangements where Neumann had ownership interests (though many were unwound prior to the SPAC)

3. **Management and Board Relationships**
   - Typical related-party disclosures regarding compensation and indemnification agreements with directors and officers

### Limitations of My Knowledge:

**I don't have reliable information about:**
- The specific dollar amounts of each related-party transaction at the time of the SPAC merger
- The complete list of all disclosed related-party transactions in the proxy/S-4 filing
- Any new related-party arrangements specifically created as part of the BowX transaction structure
