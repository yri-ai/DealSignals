**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

Based on the structure of this SPAC transaction, the parties most likely to benefit from closing include:

**1. WeWork/Adam Neumann & Early Investors**
- Provides path to public markets after the failed 2019 IPO debacle
- Allows existing shareholders to eventually liquidate positions
- Adam Neumann, despite his reduced role, still held significant equity
- SoftBank gains ability to eventually monetize its massive investment (though at substantial losses from original valuations)

**2. BowX Sponsors (Vivek Ranadivé and team)**
- SPAC sponsors typically hold founder shares acquired at nominal cost (~$25,000 for ~20% of SPAC)
- These "promote" shares become valuable upon deal closing
- Sponsors often negotiate additional incentives

**3. PIPE Investors (at the stated terms)**
- Got to invest at known valuation with public company liquidity coming

**Parties with more mixed outcomes:**
- **Public SPAC shareholders** - historically, SPAC retail investors have often seen post-merger declines; they take on significant risk
- **SoftBank** - benefits from liquidity path but was crystallizing massive losses versus original investment thesis

**Caveat:** I'm describing typical SPAC dynamics applied to this deal. The actual long-term outcome for WeWork post-merger was quite poor (eventual bankruptcy in 2023), though that wasn't knowable at transaction time.
