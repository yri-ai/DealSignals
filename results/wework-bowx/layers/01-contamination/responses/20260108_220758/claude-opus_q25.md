## Answer: Top 5 Risk Factors from WeWork/BowX S-4

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork/BowX merger and typical SPAC disclosures of this nature, the S-4 likely highlighted these major risk categories:

### Likely Top Risk Factors:

1. **History of Significant Losses / Path to Profitability Uncertain**
   - WeWork had accumulated billions in losses and had never achieved profitability

2. **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Flexible Workspace Demand**
   - Uncertainty around return-to-office trends and occupancy rates

3. **Long-term Lease Obligations vs. Short-term Member Agreements**
   - The fundamental business model mismatch creating cash flow risk

4. **Ability to Retain and Grow Enterprise Membership Base**
   - Dependency on shifting toward larger, more stable corporate clients

5. **Significant Indebtedness and Need for Additional Capital**
   - Substantial debt load and ongoing capital requirements

### Important Caveat:

**I don't have reliable, precise information** about the exact wording or official ranking of risk factors as they appeared in the S-4 filing. The above reflects:
- General knowledge of WeWork's well-publicized business challenges
- Standard SPAC merger risk disclosure patterns
- Media coverage from that period

To verify the actual top 5 risk factors as prioritized in the S-4 document, you would need to reference the SEC filing directly (typically found in the "Risk Factors" section of the registration statement).
