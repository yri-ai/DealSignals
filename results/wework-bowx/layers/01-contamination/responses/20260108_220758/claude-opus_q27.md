**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

Based on my training knowledge, I can provide the following about WeWork's customer concentration dynamics:

**General Customer Base Structure:**
- WeWork historically had a highly diversified customer base with thousands of members/tenants
- No single customer typically represented a dominant percentage of revenue, which was generally viewed as a positive diversification factor
- The membership model meant revenue was spread across many small-to-medium enterprise customers and individual members

**Shift Toward Enterprise Clients:**
- Leading up to and during the SPAC period, WeWork was actively shifting toward larger enterprise customers
- Enterprise clients (companies with 500+ employees) were becoming a larger portion of the revenue mix
- This was positioned as improving revenue quality and reducing churn, though it could increase concentration risk over time

**What I'm Less Certain About:**
- I don't have reliable specific figures on exact customer concentration percentages (e.g., "top 10 customers = X% of revenue") from the BowX S-4 filing
- I cannot confirm precise enterprise vs. SMB revenue splits at the time of the merger

**Known Risk Factors:**
- Geographic concentration was more notable than individual customer concentration
- Major markets like NYC, London, and a few others represented outsized portions of revenue

*If you need precise concentration metrics from the merger documents, I would recommend consulting the S-4 filing directly.*
