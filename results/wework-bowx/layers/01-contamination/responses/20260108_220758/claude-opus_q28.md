Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger:

## Key-Person Dependencies

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

### Primary Key-Person Risk: Adam Neumann (Historical)
- Adam Neumann was the co-founder and former CEO whose departure in 2019 was a major inflection point
- His removal was required by SoftBank as a condition of their bailout
- The company's brand and culture were heavily tied to his persona
- His departure created significant uncertainty about the company's identity and direction

### Sandeep Mathrani (CEO at time of SPAC)
**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**
- Brought in as CEO in February 2020 to lead the turnaround
- Real estate industry veteran (former CEO of GGP/Brookfield Properties retail)
- The SPAC deal and turnaround strategy were closely associated with his leadership
- Investor confidence was substantially tied to his credibility and execution ability

### Key Dependency Risks I Recall:
- Reliance on Mathrani's turnaround expertise
- Smaller executive bench compared to pre-2019
- SoftBank's continued involvement as controlling shareholder (Masayoshi Son's decisions)

**What I'm uncertain about:**
I don't have reliable, specific information about:
- Detailed employment agreements or non-compete terms
- Specific succession planning disclosures in the SPAC filings
- Quantified key-person insurance arrangements
- Other specific executives named as key-person risks in the S-4/proxy

These details would require review of the actual merger documentation.
