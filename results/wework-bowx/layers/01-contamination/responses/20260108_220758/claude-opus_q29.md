## Response: Discrepancies Between S-4 and Investor Presentation

**Confidence: LOW**
**Source: UNCERTAIN**

I don't have reliable specific information about detailed discrepancies between the WeWork/BowX S-4 filing and investor presentation.

### What I Can Say Generally

From my training knowledge, I'm aware that:

1. **Common SPAC disclosure issues** in this era often included:
   - Investor presentations featuring more aggressive growth projections than S-4 risk disclosures
   - Different revenue/membership growth assumptions between documents
   - Varying emphasis on profitability timelines

2. **WeWork-specific context**: The company had previously faced scrutiny during its failed 2019 IPO for aggressive metrics (like "community-adjusted EBITDA"), so there was heightened attention on their 2021 SPAC disclosures.

### What I Don't Know Reliably

- Specific numerical discrepancies between the documents
- Exact wording differences in projections
- Whether regulators or analysts flagged particular inconsistencies
- Details of any subsequent SEC comment letters or enforcement actions

### Recommendation

For accurate information on document discrepancies, I would recommend:
- Reviewing the actual S-4 filed with the SEC (EDGAR database)
- Comparing to archived investor presentation materials
- Checking SEC comment letter correspondence
- Reviewing contemporaneous analyst reports or financial journalism

**I should not speculate on specific discrepancies without reliable source material.**
