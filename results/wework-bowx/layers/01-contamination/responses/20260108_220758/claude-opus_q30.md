# Analysis: Scenarios That Could Cause WeWork/BowX Investment to Go to Zero

**Confidence Level: [MEDIUM-HIGH]**
**Source: [TRAINING]**

Based on my training knowledge about WeWork and SPAC investments generally, here are the primary zero-value scenarios:

## 1. **Bankruptcy/Liquidation**
- WeWork filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2023 (this is from my training data)
- In a liquidation scenario, common shareholders (including those who received shares via the SPAC merger) are last in line after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders
- Given WeWork's substantial debt load, equity holders could receive nothing

## 2. **Delisting and Eventual Worthlessness**
- If the stock price fell below exchange minimums for extended periods
- WeWork was indeed delisted from NYSE in 2023

## 3. **Debt Restructuring Wiping Out Equity**
- Debt-to-equity conversions that massively dilute existing shareholders
- Creditors taking ownership in exchange for debt forgiveness

## 4. **Continued Cash Burn Without Path to Profitability**
- WeWork's business model required sustained capital
- Inability to refinance maturing debt obligations

## What Actually Happened
**[HIGH confidence - TRAINING]**

WeWork did file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2023. While I don't have complete information on the final outcome for shareholders, bankruptcy proceedings for companies with WeWork's debt levels typically result in common equity being wiped out or nearly so.

**Caveat:** My training data has a cutoff, so I cannot confirm the final resolution for shareholders post-bankruptcy proceedings.
