Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger in 2021, I can address what would need to be true for WeWork's projections to be achieved:

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

For WeWork's projections in the SPAC merger materials to be achieved, several key assumptions would have needed to hold true:

1. **Demand Recovery Post-COVID**: The projections assumed a strong recovery in demand for flexible office space as the pandemic waned and workers returned to offices (at least partially).

2. **Continued Enterprise Shift**: WeWork was banking on growth in enterprise clients (larger corporate customers) rather than individual/small business members, which they positioned as more stable revenue.

3. **Improved Unit Economics**: The company projected significant margin improvement, requiring successful renegotiation of lease terms and more disciplined expansion compared to the pre-IPO era under Adam Neumann.

4. **Occupancy Rate Improvements**: Projections typically assumed occupancy returning to and exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

5. **Cost Structure Optimization**: Assumptions about reduced SG&A and more efficient operations after the restructuring.

**What I'm less certain about [UNCERTAIN]:**
- The specific numerical targets in the projections
- The exact timeline assumptions
- Detailed breakdowns by geography or segment

I should note that SPAC projections were widely scrutinized during this period, and many analysts expressed skepticism about whether WeWork's aggressive growth assumptions were realistic given the uncertain post-pandemic office market dynamics.
