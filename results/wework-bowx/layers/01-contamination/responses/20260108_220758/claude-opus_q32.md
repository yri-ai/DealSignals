**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

The strongest argument for the WeWork-BowX SPAC deal was that it provided WeWork a **viable path to becoming a public company after its catastrophic failed IPO in 2019**, at a time when:

1. **Market timing for SPACs was favorable** - 2021 was peak SPAC activity, allowing companies to go public with less scrutiny than traditional IPOs

2. **WeWork had undergone significant restructuring** - Under new CEO Sandeep Mathrani, the company had cut costs dramatically, exited unprofitable leases, and presented a more disciplined operational story

3. **Pandemic recovery narrative** - There was a thesis that demand for flexible office space would increase as companies adopted hybrid work models, making WeWork's model potentially more relevant

4. **Capital infusion needed** - WeWork needed liquidity, and the SPAC provided access to public markets capital

**Caveat:** While these were the *arguments made at the time*, I should note that hindsight proved many of these bullish assumptions wrong - WeWork filed for bankruptcy in late 2023. The "strongest argument" was more about narrative and market conditions than fundamental value creation.

**What I'm less certain about:** The specific financial projections or detailed terms that BowX used to justify the deal - I have general knowledge of the transaction rationale but not granular deal metrics.
