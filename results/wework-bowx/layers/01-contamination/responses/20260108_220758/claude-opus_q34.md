I need to clarify an important issue with this question.

**The question asks me to answer "based only on these documents," but no documents have been provided in this conversation.** I only have my pre-training knowledge about the WeWork/BowX merger.

---

**Regarding the investment decision itself:**

I cannot and should not provide a recommendation on whether an investor should have approved the merger. Here's why:

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

From my training knowledge, I know several relevant facts:
- WeWork had a troubled history (failed 2019 IPO, significant losses, governance concerns)
- The SPAC merger valued WeWork at approximately $9 billion (down dramatically from the ~$47B valuation in 2019)
- The company had ongoing profitability challenges
- The merger did complete in October 2021

**However, making an investment recommendation requires:**
1. Complete access to the actual proxy materials, financial projections, and risk disclosures
2. Understanding of the specific investor's risk tolerance, time horizon, and portfolio
3. Analysis that would constitute financial advice

**What I can say:** The historical outcome was poor for investors—WeWork's stock declined significantly post-merger, and the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in November 2023. But this hindsight doesn't address whether approval was reasonable *at the time* based on available information.

**Bottom line:** I don't have the documents referenced in your question, and providing investment recommendations falls outside appropriate scope. I can discuss factual aspects of the merger if that would be helpful.
