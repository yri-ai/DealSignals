## Questions I Would Ask Management Before Deciding on WeWork/BowX Investment

**[HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]**

Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC situation in 2021, here are the critical questions I would pose to management:

### Financial Sustainability
1. **Path to profitability:** What specific cost reductions and revenue improvements will achieve positive EBITDA, and by when?
2. **Cash runway:** Given the current burn rate, how long until additional capital raises are needed?
3. **Unit economics:** What is the current contribution margin per desk/member, and how has it trended?

### Business Model
4. **Lease flexibility:** What percentage of lease obligations are now variable/flexible vs. fixed long-term commitments?
5. **Enterprise mix:** What's the breakdown of enterprise vs. individual members, and what's the retention rate for each?
6. **Occupancy trajectory:** What occupancy rate is needed for breakeven at the location level?

### Governance & Strategy
7. **Adam Neumann separation:** What ongoing financial obligations or relationships exist with the former CEO?
8. **SoftBank relationship:** What are SoftBank's intentions regarding their stake and ongoing support?
9. **Competition response:** How will you compete against traditional landlords now offering flexible options?

### SPAC-Specific
10. **Valuation justification:** Why is the $9B valuation appropriate given the failed 2019 IPO at higher valuations under better conditions?
11. **Redemption expectations:** What happens to the deal if redemptions exceed certain thresholds?
