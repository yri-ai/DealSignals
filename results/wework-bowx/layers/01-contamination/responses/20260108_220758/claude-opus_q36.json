They were often described as a market leader or dominant player in the sector.\n\nHowever, I don't have specific, reliable figures for their exact market share percentage. Market share in this industry is also complicated to measure because:\n- The \"flexible workspace\" market can be defined differently (coworking only vs. all flexible office arrangements)\n- Geographic scope matters (global vs. specific markets like the US)\n- Market share could be measured by square footage, revenue, number of members, or number of locations\n\nI recall seeing various estimates in the range of 5-15% of the global flexible workspace market in materials from that era, but I'm not confident in citing a specific figure as accurate, and these numbers varied significantly depending on the source and methodology.\n\n**Recommendation:** For accurate market share data, I would recommend consulting the actual S-4/proxy materials from the BowX merger, industry reports from JLL, CBRE, or Cushman & Wakefield, or specialized coworking industry analysts from that period.",
