**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's precise market share in the flexible workspace industry.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**What I can say:**

From my training knowledge, I know that WeWork was generally considered one of the largest players in the flexible/coworking workspace industry globally prior to and around the time of the SPAC merger. They were often described as a market leader or dominant player in the sector.

However, I don't have specific, reliable figures for their exact market share percentage. Market share in this industry is also complicated to measure because:
- The "flexible workspace" market can be defined differently (coworking only vs. all flexible office arrangements)
- Geographic scope matters (global vs. specific markets like the US)
- Market share could be measured by square footage, revenue, number of members, or number of locations

I recall seeing various estimates in the range of 5-15% of the global flexible workspace market in materials from that era, but I'm not confident in citing a specific figure as accurate, and these numbers varied significantly depending on the source and methodology.

**Recommendation:** For accurate market share data, I would recommend consulting the actual S-4/proxy materials from the BowX merger, industry reports from JLL, CBRE, or Cushman & Wakefield, or specialized coworking industry analysts from that period.
