**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific customer acquisition cost (CAC) metrics from the BowX SPAC merger materials.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**Explanation:** Customer acquisition cost is a metric that varies significantly by:
- Time period measured
- How "customer" is defined (individual members vs. enterprise accounts)
- What costs are included in the calculation
- Geographic market

While WeWork would have disclosed various financial and operational metrics in their SPAC investor presentation and S-4 filing, I don't have specific, reliable recall of a precise CAC figure from those documents.

**What I can say with MEDIUM confidence [TRAINING]:** WeWork's business model historically involved significant upfront investment in locations with the expectation of filling capacity over time. Their sales approach included both direct enterprise sales (higher CAC but larger contracts) and individual/small business memberships (often lower CAC through digital marketing and walk-ins). The unit economics and customer acquisition efficiency were key concerns for investors given the company's history of losses.

If you need the specific CAC figures, I'd recommend reviewing the actual BowX/WeWork investor presentation or the S-4 merger filing directly.
