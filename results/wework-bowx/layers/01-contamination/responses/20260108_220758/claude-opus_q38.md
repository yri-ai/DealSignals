**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about specific competitor occupancy rates from the WeWork/BowX merger period.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**What I can offer as general context:**

From my training knowledge, I'm aware that:
- WeWork's main competitors in the flexible/coworking space included IWG (Regus/Spaces), Industrious, and Knotel
- Occupancy rates in the flexible office industry typically ranged from 70-85% for mature locations pre-pandemic
- The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted occupancy across the entire flexible office sector in 2020-2021

**Why I'm uncertain:**
- I don't have specific occupancy rate figures for WeWork's competitors during the 2021 SPAC merger timeframe
- Competitor occupancy data is often proprietary and not consistently reported publicly
- The pandemic created highly volatile occupancy conditions that varied significantly by market and timing

If this information was disclosed in the BowX merger proxy or investor presentations as competitive benchmarking, I don't have reliable recall of those specific figures. I would recommend consulting the actual merger documents or industry reports from that period for accurate competitor metrics.
