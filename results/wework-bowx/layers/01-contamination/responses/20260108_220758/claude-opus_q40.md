**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about the specific 2021 revenue projection from WeWork's 2019 IPO S-1 filing.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**What I do know:** WeWork filed an S-1 in August 2019 in preparation for its planned IPO, and the document contained forward-looking financial projections. However, I cannot recall with confidence the specific dollar figure projected for 2021 revenue. The S-1 was notable for revealing significant losses and aggressive growth assumptions, which contributed to investor skepticism and the eventual withdrawal of the IPO.

Rather than guess at a specific number (which could be misleading for your analysis), I'd recommend consulting the original S-1 filing available through SEC EDGAR for the precise 2021 revenue projection figure.
