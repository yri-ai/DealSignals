I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific "revenue per available desk/workstation" metric from the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

Confidence: LOW
Source: UNCERTAIN

This appears to be a company-specific operational metric that may not have been prominently disclosed in the public materials I was trained on. While I understand this would be calculated as total revenue divided by total available desks/workstations, I don't have the actual figures or whether this specific metric was reported in the WeWork/BowX documentation.
