In the transaction with BowX Acquisition Corp in2021, SoftBank converted a significant portion of its preferred shares to common shares and also participated in the PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) financing that was part of the deal structure.The merger allowed SoftBank to maintain a substantial ownership stake in the combined company while providing WeWork with additional capital and public market access.**Confidence: MEDIUM****[TRAINING]**My knowledge of the specific details and exact ownership percentages before and after the merger transaction is limited, so I'm drawing from my general training about this transaction.<|im_end|>",
