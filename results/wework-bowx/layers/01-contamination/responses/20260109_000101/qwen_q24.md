Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in2021, the parties that would benefit most from this transaction closing include:1. **WeWork shareholders and stakeholders** - The SPAC merger provided WeWork with access to public markets and capital without going through a traditional IPO process, which was particularly valuable given WeWork's previous governance issues and need for capital restructuring.2. **BowX Acquisition Corp. shareholders** - As the acquiring SPAC, their investors would benefit from participating in the combined entity's potential upside, though they also took on the risk of WeWork's turnaround prospects.3. **SoftBank** - As WeWork's major investor, SoftBank had significant exposure to WeWork's previous struggles and stood to benefit from the company's capital restructuring and path to public markets.**Confidence: MEDIUM****Source: TRAINING**Note: This assessment is based on the general structure and announced benefits of SPAC mergers, particularly for companies seeking to restructure and access public capital markets after operational challenges.<|im_end|>
