Based on my training knowledge, the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in2021 had several key-person dependencies, most notably:1. **Adam Neumann** - As WeWork's controversial former CEO and largest shareholder, his continued involvement and support was critical to the merger's success and market perception2. **Management team retention and commitment** - The willingness of WeWork's management team to stay with the combined company post-merger3. **Sponsor support** - Key stakeholders like SoftBank and other major investors who provided backstop commitmentsHowever, I should note that while I understand the general concept of key-person dependencies in SPAC mergers, I don't have comprehensive details about all specific individuals or relationships that were material to this particular transaction.**Confidence: MEDIUM****Knowledge Source: TRAINING**The Adam Neumann dependency was the most publicly discussed key-person risk, but I cannot be certain I have captured all material key-person dependencies from this transaction.<|im_end|>
