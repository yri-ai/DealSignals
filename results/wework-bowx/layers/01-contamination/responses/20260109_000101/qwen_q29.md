I don't have reliable information about specific discrepancies between the S-4 filing and investor presentation documents for the WeWork/BowX merger. While I'm aware that WeWork did pursue a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in2021, I don't have detailed knowledge of the specific contents or discrepancies between these particular documents.[LOW] confidence[UNCERTAIN]<|im_end|>
