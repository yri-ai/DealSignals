Based on my training knowledge, several factors could potentially cause the WeWork investment to go to zero:1. **Bankruptcy or liquidation** - If WeWork were to file for bankruptcy and liquidate, equity holders (including SPAC investors) could lose their entire investment.2. **Severe business deterioration** - If the company's financial performance collapsed, share price could theoretically drop to zero, though this would also eliminate all other equity value.3. **Material breach of SPAC terms** - If WeWork materially breached the SPAC merger agreement terms in a way that fundamentally undermined the transaction, it could create conditions leading to total loss of value.[HIGH] confidence[TRAINING]These represent general investment risks that apply to any SPAC merger transaction, based on my understanding of how such transactions typically work and what can go wrong from an investment perspective.<|im_end|>
