Based on my training knowledge, Adam Neumann resigned as CEO of WeWork in2019 following the company's IPO controversies and subsequent collapse of the IPO process. By2021, when the SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp was announced, Neumann had no ongoing operational involvement with the company. The SPAC merger was led by new leadership, with Marcelo Claure becoming CEO and Thomas Neumann (Adam's father) becoming Chairman.[HIGH] confidence[TRAINING]Note: This represents my pre-existing knowledge from training about the timeline and leadership changes at WeWork during this period.<|im_end|>
