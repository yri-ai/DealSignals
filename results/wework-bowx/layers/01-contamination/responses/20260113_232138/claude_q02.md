I don't have reliable information about the specific year-over-year revenue growth rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I don't have reliable specific financial metrics like the exact revenue growth rate from my training data. To provide accurate financial figures like this, I would need access to the actual investor presentations, SEC filings, or proxy statements from that transaction.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The SEC Form S-4 or proxy statement filed for the merger
- WeWork's investor presentation from the SPAC announcement
- Financial news coverage from that period (around March-October 2021)
