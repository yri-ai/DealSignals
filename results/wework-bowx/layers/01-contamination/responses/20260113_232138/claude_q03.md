I don't have reliable information about the specific operating losses for WeWork in the most recent period prior to or during the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- WeWork had a history of significant operating losses in the years leading up to this transaction
- The company was known for unprofitability during its earlier growth phase

I cannot reliably cite specific operating loss figures for any particular quarter or period without risking inaccuracy. Financial figures like operating losses would have been disclosed in SEC filings (like the proxy statement or S-4), but I don't have reliable recall of those specific numbers from my training data.

To get accurate operating loss figures, you would need to reference the actual SEC filings from that transaction.
