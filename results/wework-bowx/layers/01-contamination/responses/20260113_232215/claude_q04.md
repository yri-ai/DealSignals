I don't have reliable information about the specific cash burn rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork had significant cash burn issues historically (particularly leading up to its failed 2019 IPO), I cannot provide specific figures for the cash burn rate during the 2021 SPAC merger period without risking inaccuracy.

Cash burn rate would have been a critical metric disclosed in the merger documentation, but I don't have reliable access to those specific figures from my training data.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The SEC Form S-4 or investor presentation from the BowX-WeWork merger
- WeWork's financial statements from Q1-Q2 2021
- The proxy statement distributed to BowX shareholders
