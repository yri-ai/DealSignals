I don't have reliable information about the specific cash runway at current burn rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- Cash runway and burn rate were significant concerns for WeWork given its history of losses
- The SPAC merger was designed in part to provide WeWork with additional capital

I do not have specific, reliable figures from my training data about:
- The exact cash runway projected at the time of the merger
- The specific monthly or quarterly burn rate
- How long the capital from the SPAC transaction was expected to last

This type of detailed financial metric would have been disclosed in SEC filings (like the S-4 or investor presentations), but I cannot reliably recall the specific numbers from my training data.
