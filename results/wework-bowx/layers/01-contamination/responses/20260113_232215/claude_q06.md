I don't have reliable information about the specific path to profitability and timeline stated in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documents.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I cannot reliably recall the specific profitability targets, metrics, or timelines that were presented in their investor materials or SEC filings for that transaction. 

To get accurate information about:
- The projected timeline to profitability
- Key metrics or milestones outlined
- The specific path/strategy described

You would need to consult the actual merger documents, investor presentations, or SEC filings (such as the S-4 registration statement) from that transaction.
