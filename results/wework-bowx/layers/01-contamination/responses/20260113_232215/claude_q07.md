I don't have reliable information about the specific key assumptions underlying the projections for the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, I don't have detailed knowledge from my training data about the specific financial projection assumptions that were disclosed in their investor presentations or SEC filings (such as the assumptions about:
- Occupancy rates
- Revenue per member
- Operating expense ratios
- Market growth rates
- Geographic expansion plans
- Cost structure improvements
- Or other key modeling inputs)

To get accurate information about these projection assumptions, you would need to review the actual investor presentation materials, proxy statements, or SEC filings (like the Form S-4) from that transaction, which would contain the detailed footnotes and assumptions supporting their financial forecasts.
