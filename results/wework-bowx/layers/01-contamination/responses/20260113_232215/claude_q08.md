I don't have reliable information about the specific contribution margin per membership figure for WeWork in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- Contribution margin per membership would be a key operational metric for WeWork's business model (revenue per member minus variable costs per member)
- This type of metric would likely have been disclosed in SPAC merger presentations/filings

I do not have reliable recall of the specific numerical value or how it was calculated in their merger materials. This is the type of specific financial detail that would require referring to the actual investor presentation or SEC filings from that transaction.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking the original BowX-WeWork investor presentation or the SEC Form S-4 filing from 2021.
