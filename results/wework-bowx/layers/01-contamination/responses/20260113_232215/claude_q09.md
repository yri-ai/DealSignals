I don't have reliable information about the specific "revenue per available desk/workstation" metric for WeWork's SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, and that revenue per desk/workstation would be a relevant operational metric for a coworking company like WeWork, I cannot provide specific figures or detailed information about this metric from that transaction.

This type of specific financial metric would have been disclosed in SEC filings (like the S-4 registration statement or investor presentations), but I don't have reliable recall of those exact figures from my training data.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The SEC EDGAR database for the S-4 filing
- WeWork's investor presentation materials from the merger period
- The proxy statement/prospectus from the transaction
