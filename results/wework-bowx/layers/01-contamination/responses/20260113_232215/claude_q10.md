I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific occupancy rates or trends during the BowX SPAC merger period in 2021.

**What I can tell you [TRAINING - HIGH confidence]:**

**Occupancy rate definition:** In the context of flexible workspace companies like WeWork, occupancy rate typically measures the percentage of available desks/offices that are leased or occupied by members, calculated as:
- Occupied workstations / Total available workstations × 100

**General WeWork context [TRAINING - MEDIUM confidence]:**
- WeWork historically struggled with profitability despite growing membership
- Occupancy rates are a critical metric for workspace operators as they directly impact revenue
- The company faced challenges around the failed 2019 IPO

**Regarding specific occupancy trends during the 2021 BowX merger [UNCERTAIN - LOW confidence]:**
I don't have reliable specific data about:
- Exact occupancy percentages at the time of the SPAC announcement or closing
- Quarter-by-quarter trends during 2021
- How COVID-19 specifically impacted their occupancy during this period
- Comparative occupancy rates to pre-pandemic levels

To get accurate information about WeWork's occupancy rates during the BowX merger, you would need to consult the actual SPAC merger documents, investor presentations, or SEC filings from that period.
