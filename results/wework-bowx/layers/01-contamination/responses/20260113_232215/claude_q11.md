**Member churn rate** is a metric that measures the percentage of customers (or "members" in subscription-based businesses) who discontinue their service or membership during a specific time period.

The formula is typically:
Churn Rate = (Number of customers lost during period / Total customers at start of period) × 100

For example, if a company starts a month with 1,000 members and loses 50 members during that month, the monthly churn rate would be 5%.

This is a **general business metric** commonly used in:
- Subscription services
- SaaS companies
- Membership organizations
- Coworking spaces (like WeWork)

**Regarding WeWork/BowX specifically:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

I know that member churn would have been a relevant metric for WeWork as a coworking/flexible workspace provider with membership-based revenue, and it would likely have been discussed in SPAC merger materials. However, I don't recall the specific churn rate figures from the WeWork-BowX transaction documents without reviewing them directly.

Is there a specific aspect of WeWork's member churn rate from the 2021 SPAC merger you're interested in?
