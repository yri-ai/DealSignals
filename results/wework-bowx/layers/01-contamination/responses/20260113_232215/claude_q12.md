I don't have reliable information about the specific average revenue per member figure for WeWork in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, and that "average revenue per member" would be a standard metric for WeWork's business (calculated as total revenue divided by number of members), I cannot reliably recall the specific numerical value that would have been disclosed in their merger documentation or investor presentations from that time period.

To get accurate figures, you would need to reference:
- The investor presentation from the SPAC merger announcement
- SEC filings (Form S-4 or proxy materials)
- WeWork's financial disclosures from that period

I prefer not to guess at financial metrics when I cannot verify them from my training data.
