I don't have reliable information about the specific total lease obligations figure for WeWork in relation to the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork's business model was heavily dependent on leasing office space long-term and subleasing short-term
- Lease obligations were a critical financial metric for WeWork given this was their primary cost structure
- The company had substantial lease commitments that were a major concern for investors

I cannot provide a specific dollar amount for their total lease obligations at the time of the 2021 BowX merger without potentially making up information. This would have been disclosed in the merger documents (S-4 filing or investor presentation), but I don't have reliable recall of the exact figures from my training data.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking the actual SEC filings from that transaction.
