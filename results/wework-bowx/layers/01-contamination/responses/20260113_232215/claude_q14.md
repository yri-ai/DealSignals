I don't have reliable information about the specific duration profile of WeWork's lease commitments in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know from general knowledge that WeWork's business model historically involved long-term lease commitments (often 10-15 years) that they would sublease on shorter terms (creating a duration mismatch risk), I cannot provide specific numbers or details about the lease commitment duration profile as it existed at the time of the 2021 BowX merger without risking speculation.

If this information was disclosed in the merger documents or investor presentations, I don't have reliable recall of those specific figures from my training data.
