I don't have reliable information about the specific lease termination provisions in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- WeWork's business model fundamentally involves leasing office space and subleasing it
- Lease obligations were critical liabilities for WeWork

I do not have reliable specific details from my training data about the particular lease termination provisions that were disclosed or negotiated as part of the SPAC merger transaction documents.

To get accurate information about lease termination provisions, you would need to review:
- The actual merger proxy statement/S-4 filing
- WeWork's SEC filings from that period
- The definitive merger agreement

I should not speculate on the specific terms, as lease provisions can vary significantly and would be material information requiring precise accuracy.
