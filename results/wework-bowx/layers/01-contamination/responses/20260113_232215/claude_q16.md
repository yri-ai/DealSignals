I don't have reliable information about this specific detail regarding WeWork's business model at 70% occupancy in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I have general knowledge that WeWork's business model involves leasing office space long-term and subleasing short-term (making occupancy rates critical to profitability), I cannot reliably recall specific threshold figures like "70% occupancy" or what specific business outcomes were projected at that level in their SPAC merger materials.

This seems like it would be a specific data point from investor presentations or SEC filings related to the merger, and I should not speculate about what might happen at that particular occupancy threshold without being certain of the information.
