I don't have reliable information about this specific detail from the WeWork-BowX merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork merged with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I don't have reliable training data about specific operational thresholds or what happens to the business at particular occupancy levels like 50%. 

This seems like it would be detailed in investor presentations or financial models from that transaction, but I cannot confidently recall such specific operational metrics from my training data. Rather than guess about whether 50% occupancy represents a break-even point, profitability threshold, or some other operational milestone, I should acknowledge I don't have this information.
