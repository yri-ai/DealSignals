I don't have reliable information about the specific implied enterprise value from the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I cannot reliably recall the specific enterprise value figure from my training data. Enterprise values in SPAC deals are typically disclosed in the merger announcements and investor presentations, but I don't want to risk providing an incorrect number.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The original merger announcement press releases from March 2021
- The SEC filings (S-4 registration statement)
- Official investor presentations from BowX/WeWork

These would contain the authoritative figures for the transaction's implied enterprise value.
