I don't have reliable information about the specific valuation methodology used to justify the price in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that the WeWork-BowX merger occurred in 2021 and that WeWork had a troubled history following its failed IPO attempt in 2019, I cannot reliably recall the specific valuation methodologies detailed in the merger documentation. 

SPAC mergers typically use methodologies like:
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis
- Comparable company analysis
- Precedent transaction analysis

However, I cannot confirm which specific methodology or combination was primarily used to justify WeWork's valuation in this particular transaction without speculating.

If you need this information, I would recommend reviewing the actual merger proxy statement or investor presentation that was filed with the SEC, as those documents would contain the detailed valuation analysis.
