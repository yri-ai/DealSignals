I don't have reliable information about the specific comparable transactions or companies cited in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC merger presentations typically include comparable company analyses (often citing other real estate, flexible workspace, or proptech companies)
- Such presentations usually reference comparable SPAC transactions from the same period

I cannot reliably tell you which specific companies or transactions were actually cited in the WeWork-BowX materials without access to the actual investor presentation or SEC filings from that deal.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review:
- The original investor presentation deck
- The SEC S-4 filing or proxy statement
- Any fairness opinions that were issued

I should not speculate on which comparables were used, as this would be making up specific information.
