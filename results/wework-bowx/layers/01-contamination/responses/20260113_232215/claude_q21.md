# Key Executives - WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

## [MEDIUM] Confidence - [TRAINING]

Based on my training knowledge about the 2021 WeWork-BowX merger:

### WeWork Leadership:

1. **Sandeep Mathrani** - CEO
   - Brought in as CEO in February 2020 (post-Adam Neumann era)
   - Track record: Former CEO of Brookfield Properties' retail group and CBL Properties
   - Known as a real estate turnaround specialist
   - His hiring was seen as bringing traditional real estate expertise to stabilize WeWork

2. **Adam Neumann** - (Former CEO, departed 2019)
   - While not involved in the 2021 SPAC deal, his previous leadership and the failed 2019 IPO were significant context
   - Left the company before this transaction

### BowX Acquisition Corp:

1. **Vivek Ranadivé** - Chairman/Sponsor
   - Tech entrepreneur and owner of Sacramento Kings NBA team
   - Founded TIBCO Software

I have MEDIUM confidence because while I recall these key figures from the transaction coverage, I may not have complete details about all executive team members or their specific roles during the SPAC process. The executive lineup and their backgrounds were part of the investment thesis for the restructured company.

**Note:** This reflects general knowledge from coverage of the transaction, not detailed insider information about executive track records.
