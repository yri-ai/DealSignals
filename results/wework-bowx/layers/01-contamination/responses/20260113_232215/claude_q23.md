I don't have reliable information about specific related-party transactions in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- Related-party transactions are common disclosures in SPAC mergers and typically include things like:
  - Founder shares and sponsor arrangements
  - Management agreements
  - Relationships with major shareholders
  - Transactions with affiliated entities

I cannot reliably specify what particular related-party transactions were disclosed in this specific merger without access to the actual SEC filings (S-4, proxy statements, etc.) that would contain this information.

To get accurate information about related-party transactions in this deal, you would need to review:
- The S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC
- The definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A)
- WeWork's subsequent 10-K and 10-Q filings post-merger

I apologize I cannot be more specific based on my training knowledge alone.
