I don't have reliable information about the specific management incentives and compensation structure in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC deals typically involve sponsor promotes (usually 20% of shares), management equity rollovers, and various incentive structures
- WeWork's management team (including then-CEO Sandeep Mathrani) would have had some equity compensation arrangements

I do not have reliable specific details from my training data about:
- The exact compensation packages for WeWork executives in this deal
- Specific equity grants, bonuses, or performance incentives tied to the transaction
- The BowX sponsor's promote structure and economics
- Any retention bonuses or transaction fees paid to management

To get accurate information about management compensation in this specific deal, you would need to review the actual SEC filings (S-4, proxy statements, or Form 8-K) from the 2021 transaction.
