He had departed from his CEO role in 2019 following the failed IPO attempt.\n\nHowever, regarding his **financial exposure**:\n- Neumann retained some **equity stake** in WeWork after his departure\n- He received a significant exit package in 2019 (reported to be around $1+ billion in stock, cash, and credit line)\n- His remaining equity would have been subject to the merger terms and subsequent restructuring\n\n**What I'm less certain about:**\n- The exact percentage of equity he retained through the SPAC merger\n- Specific voting rights or other ongoing contractual relationships\n- Whether he had any consulting arrangements\n\n**Note:** Neumann's departure and settlement were highly publicized, but the specific details of his ongoing financial exposure through the SPAC transaction may not have been fully disclosed in public filings I was trained on.\n\nWould you like me to clarify what I know about his 2019 departure package or the general structure of the SPAC merger?",
