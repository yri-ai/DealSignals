**Answer: Adam Neumann's Ongoing Relationship/Exposure**

[MEDIUM] confidence
[TRAINING]

Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger in 2021:

Adam Neumann, WeWork's co-founder and former CEO, was **not involved in the management or board** of WeWork at the time of the BowX merger. He had departed from his CEO role in 2019 following the failed IPO attempt.

However, regarding his **financial exposure**:
- Neumann retained some **equity stake** in WeWork after his departure
- He received a significant exit package in 2019 (reported to be around $1+ billion in stock, cash, and credit line)
- His remaining equity would have been subject to the merger terms and subsequent restructuring

**What I'm less certain about:**
- The exact percentage of equity he retained through the SPAC merger
- Specific voting rights or other ongoing contractual relationships
- Whether he had any consulting arrangements

**Note:** Neumann's departure and settlement were highly publicized, but the specific details of his ongoing financial exposure through the SPAC transaction may not have been fully disclosed in public filings I was trained on.

Would you like me to clarify what I know about his 2019 departure package or the general structure of the SPAC merger?
