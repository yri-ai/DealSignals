I don't have reliable information about the specific disclosed risk factors from the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documents.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork merged with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, I cannot reliably recall the specific risk factors that were disclosed in their merger documentation (such as the S-4 filing or investor presentation). 

Risk factors in SPAC mergers typically include items like:
- Business model viability
- Competition
- Regulatory concerns
- Financial performance and projections
- Market conditions

However, I cannot confirm which specific risk factors were highlighted as "top" risks for this particular transaction without access to the actual filing documents.

To get accurate information about the disclosed risk factors, you would need to review:
- The SEC Form S-4 filing
- The proxy statement/prospectus
- Investor presentations from that time period

These would contain the official risk factor disclosures that WeWork and BowX were required to provide to investors.
