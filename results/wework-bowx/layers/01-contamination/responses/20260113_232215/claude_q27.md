I don't have reliable information about specific material litigation or disputes related to the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork had a highly publicized failed IPO in 2019
- WeWork subsequently merged with BowX Acquisition Corp (a SPAC) in 2021
- The company had various operational and governance issues historically

I cannot reliably confirm from my training data whether there were specific material litigation matters or disputes disclosed in connection with the SPAC merger itself. Legal disputes and litigation would typically be disclosed in SEC filings like the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials, but I don't have specific recall of these details.

For accurate information about material litigation, you would need to review:
- The S-4 filing for the merger
- WeWork's periodic SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q)
- Proxy statements from that period

I should not speculate about specific legal matters without reliable information.
