I don't have reliable information about specific going concern disclosures in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documents from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did go through a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp that closed in 2021
- WeWork had significant financial challenges leading up to and during this period
- Going concern disclosures are typically included in financial statements when there's substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue operations

I cannot reliably confirm whether specific going concern language appeared in the merger documents, proxy statements, or financial disclosures without access to those specific documents. This would require knowledge of the actual SEC filings (S-4, proxy statements, or 10-K/10-Q reports) from that transaction.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review the actual SEC filings from the WeWork-BowX merger process in 2021.
