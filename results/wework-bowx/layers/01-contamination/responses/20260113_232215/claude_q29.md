I don't have reliable information about specific auditor statements regarding the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I don't have specific, reliable information from my training data about what the auditors said in their reports or opinions regarding this transaction. 

Auditor statements would typically be found in:
- SEC filings (S-4, proxy statements)
- Financial statement audit opinions
- Going concern assessments

But I cannot confidently cite specific auditor commentary from this deal without risking making up details. If you need this information, I'd recommend checking the actual SEC filings from 2021 where auditor opinions would be included.
