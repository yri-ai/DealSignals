I don't have reliable information about specific material weaknesses in internal controls for the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork had significant corporate governance and financial reporting issues historically (particularly around the failed 2019 IPO), I cannot reliably confirm specific details about material weaknesses disclosed in connection with the 2021 BowX SPAC transaction without access to the actual SEC filings from that period.

Material weaknesses in internal controls would typically be disclosed in SEC filings like the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials for a SPAC merger, but I don't have specific recall of those disclosures for this transaction.

If you need accurate information on this topic, I'd recommend reviewing:
- The S-4 filing for the BowX-WeWork merger
- Any 10-K or 10-Q filings post-merger
- The proxy statement/prospectus for the transaction
