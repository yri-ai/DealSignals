I don't have reliable information about the specific board composition following the WeWork-BowX merger.

**Confidence: LOW**
**Source: UNCERTAIN**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I don't have reliable details from my training data about the specific individuals who comprised the board of directors post-merger, their roles, or the exact board structure that resulted from this transaction.

To get accurate information about the post-merger board composition, you would need to consult:
- The definitive proxy statement/merger documents filed with the SEC
- WeWork's Form 8-K filings around the merger completion date
- Press releases from that time period
- WeWork's subsequent 10-K or 10-Q filings which would list board members

I want to be clear that I'm not guessing at board member names or composition, as that would risk providing you with inaccurate information.
