I don't have reliable information about the specific voting structure post-merger for the WeWork-BowX transaction.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021, the specific details about the post-merger voting structure (such as share classes, voting rights ratios, or special voting arrangements) are not something I can reliably recall from my training data.

Voting structures in SPAC mergers can vary significantly and often involve:
- Multi-class share structures
- Different voting rights for different stakeholders
- Special arrangements for founders/sponsors

However, I cannot confirm which, if any, of these applied to the WeWork-BowX merger without access to the specific merger documents or prospectus.
