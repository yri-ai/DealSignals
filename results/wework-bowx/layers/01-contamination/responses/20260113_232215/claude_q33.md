I don't have reliable information about the specific lock-up agreements in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that lock-up agreements are standard features in SPAC mergers (they typically restrict insiders and early investors from selling shares for a specified period, often 6-12 months after the merger closes), I cannot reliably recall the specific terms, durations, or parties involved in the lock-up agreements for this particular transaction.

To get accurate information about:
- The lock-up period duration
- Which shareholders were subject to restrictions
- Any early release provisions or conditions
- Exceptions to the lock-up terms

You would need to reference the actual merger documents, such as the SEC filings (S-4 registration statement or 8-K forms) from the WeWork-BowX transaction in 2021.
