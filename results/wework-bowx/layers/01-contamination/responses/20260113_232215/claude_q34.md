I don't have reliable information about the specific registration rights in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that SPAC mergers typically include registration rights agreements (allowing certain shareholders to require the company to register their shares for public sale), I cannot reliably recall the specific terms, parties, or conditions of registration rights in this particular transaction.

Registration rights agreements in SPAC mergers commonly cover:
- Demand registration rights (ability to force registration)
- Piggyback registration rights (ability to include shares in others' registrations)
- Lock-up period exceptions
- Covered shareholders (PIPE investors, sponsors, etc.)

However, this is general SPAC knowledge, not specific verified information about the WeWork-BowX deal.

To get accurate information about the registration rights in this specific merger, you would need to consult the actual merger documents (S-4 filing, registration rights agreement) filed with the SEC.
