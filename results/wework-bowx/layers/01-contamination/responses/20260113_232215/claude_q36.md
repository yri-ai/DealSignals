I don't have reliable information about whether comparable transactions were specifically disclosed in the WeWork-BowX merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC merger proxy statements/investor presentations typically include valuation methodologies
- Comparable company analysis and precedent transactions are standard valuation approaches

I cannot reliably confirm from my training data whether comparable/precedent transactions were actually disclosed in this specific deal's documentation. To answer this accurately, one would need to review the actual SEC filings (S-4, proxy statement, or investor presentation) from this transaction.

If this information is important for your purposes, I'd recommend checking the official SEC filings for the WeWork-BowX merger.
