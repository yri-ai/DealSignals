I don't have reliable information about the specific exit/refinancing strategy for WeWork's lease obligations in relation to the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know from my training that:
- WeWork had significant long-term lease obligations that were a major concern for the business model
- The company went through various restructuring efforts including bankruptcy in 2023
- Managing lease obligations was a critical strategic issue for WeWork

I do not have specific, reliable information about what exit or refinancing strategy was articulated for these lease obligations specifically in the context of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger documents or presentations.

This would have been detailed in the investor presentation, proxy statement, or other merger documents, but I cannot recall those specific strategic details with confidence.
