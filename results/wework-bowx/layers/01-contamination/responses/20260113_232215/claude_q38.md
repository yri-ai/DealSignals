I don't have reliable information about specific post-merger integration plans or business model changes that were planned for the WeWork-BowX merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

Here's what I can say with varying levels of certainty:

**What I know generally [TRAINING - MEDIUM confidence]:**
- WeWork went public via SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in October 2021
- This came after WeWork's failed IPO attempt in 2019
- WeWork's core business was flexible workspace/coworking spaces

**What I'm uncertain about [LOW confidence]:**
- Specific integration plans between WeWork and BowX
- Particular business model pivots or changes announced as part of the merger
- Detailed strategic initiatives planned post-merger

The nature of SPAC mergers typically involves the target company (WeWork) essentially replacing the shell company (BowX), so "integration" in the traditional M&A sense would be minimal. Any business model changes would have been WeWork's own strategic initiatives rather than integration-related changes.

If you need accurate information about specific post-merger plans, I'd recommend reviewing:
- The original SPAC merger investor presentation
- SEC filings (S-4, 8-K forms)
- WeWork's investor relations materials from that period
