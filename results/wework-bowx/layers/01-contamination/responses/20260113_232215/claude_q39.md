I don't have reliable information about the specific debt covenants and restrictions that existed in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork completed a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021 to go public, I don't have reliable details from my training data about the specific debt covenants and restrictions that were part of that transaction or WeWork's existing debt structure at that time.

Debt covenants in such transactions typically include things like:
- Financial performance metrics (leverage ratios, interest coverage)
- Restrictions on additional borrowing
- Asset sale limitations
- Requirements to maintain certain liquidity levels

However, I cannot confirm which specific covenants applied to WeWork's situation without access to the actual merger documents, SEC filings, or credit agreements from that period.

If you need this information, I would recommend reviewing:
- The Form S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC
- WeWork's 10-K filings post-merger
- Credit agreement documentation if publicly available
