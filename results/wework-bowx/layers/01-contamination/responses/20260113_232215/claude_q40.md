I don't have reliable information about this specific investment recommendation.

**[LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]**

Here's what I can say:

**What I know from training:**
- WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, going public that way after the failed 2019 IPO attempt
- This occurred after significant restructuring following Adam Neumann's departure
- The company had a troubled history including massive losses, corporate governance issues, and the dramatic 2019 IPO collapse
- The flexible workspace/co-working business model faced significant challenges, especially during COVID-19

**Why I cannot give an investment recommendation:**
1. Investment decisions require current financial data, market conditions, and forward-looking analysis that goes beyond historical facts
2. My training data has a cutoff and I don't know what information was publicly available at the time of the merger vs. afterward
3. Any investment recommendation would require analyzing: valuation, terms of the SPAC deal, post-merger business plan, competitive position, management quality, and individual investor circumstances
4. The stock performance post-merger would be relevant but I'm uncertain about those specific details

**Note:** If this is for academic/research purposes about the case study, the decision would typically involve weighing WeWork's challenged business model and history against any restructuring progress and valuation terms.
