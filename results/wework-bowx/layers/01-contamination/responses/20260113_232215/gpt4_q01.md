I don't have reliable information about WeWork's revenue for the most recent reported period. WeWork’s revenue changes each quarter/year, and without access to up-to-date filings in this context I can’t state the latest figure accurately.

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: **Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (time-sensitive financial reporting), not general knowledge**
