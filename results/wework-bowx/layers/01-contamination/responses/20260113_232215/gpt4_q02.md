I don't have reliable information about the year-over-year revenue growth rate for WeWork in the context of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger, because “YoY revenue growth” depends on the specific fiscal periods being compared (e.g., 2020 vs. 2019, 2021E vs. 2020, quarter vs. quarter), and I don’t have a single confirmed figure from my training data that I can cite without risking inaccuracy.

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Case note:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (period-dependent metric)
