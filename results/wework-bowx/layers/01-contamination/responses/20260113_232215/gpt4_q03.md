I don’t have reliable information about the specific “operating losses for the most recent period” in the WeWork–BowX 2021 SPAC merger materials.

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Note:** This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** and depends on which filing/period (“most recent period”) you mean (e.g., last quarter vs. last fiscal year at the time of the merger announcement).
