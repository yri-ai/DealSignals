**Answer:** I don’t have reliable information about the cash burn rate (i.e., a specific dollar-per-month or dollar-per-quarter figure) for WeWork in the context of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger from my training data. “Cash burn rate” is generally the rate at which a company uses up cash (often measured as negative free cash flow or net cash used in operating activities over a period), but I can’t provide a specific value here without guessing.
