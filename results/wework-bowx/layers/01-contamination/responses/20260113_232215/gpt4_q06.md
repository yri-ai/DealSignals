1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
I don’t have reliable information about the specific **“path to profitability” and the exact timeline stated** in WeWork’s 2021 SPAC merger materials with BowX (e.g., a precise year/quarter target like “profitability by 2023/2024” or the specific operational steps and milestones as stated in the investor presentation). I’m aware at a **general level** that WeWork discussed improving unit economics, reducing costs, increasing occupancy, and focusing on higher-margin, more stable revenue to move toward profitability, but I **cannot reliably state the exact timeline they publicly guided to** in the BowX deal documentation without risking inaccuracy.

2) **Confidence level:** **LOW**

3) **General vs. specific to WeWork/BowX:**  
This is **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, and I do **not** have reliable, specific recall of the stated timeline from training data.
