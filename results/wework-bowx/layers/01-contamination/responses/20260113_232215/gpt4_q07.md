I don’t have reliable information about the *specific key assumptions underlying the projections* used in the WeWork–BowX 2021 SPAC merger materials (e.g., the exact revenue growth, occupancy, desk/seat pricing, churn, cost structure, capex, or margin assumptions stated in their investor presentation/forecasts).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Case specificity: **Specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (not general knowledge)
