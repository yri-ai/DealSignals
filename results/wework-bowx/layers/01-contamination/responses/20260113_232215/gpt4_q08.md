**Answer:** Contribution margin per membership is a unit profitability metric that measures the contribution margin generated per member (or per membership) over a period. It is typically calculated as:

- **Contribution margin per membership = (Revenue per membership − direct variable costs to service that membership)**
- In a WeWork-style context, “direct variable costs” often refer to costs directly tied to delivering the workspace/service (e.g., building-level operating expenses and other directly attributable costs), excluding broader fixed corporate overhead and non-cash items. The exact definition can vary by company’s reporting.
