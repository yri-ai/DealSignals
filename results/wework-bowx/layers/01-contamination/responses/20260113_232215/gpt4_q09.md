Revenue per available desk/workstation is a unit metric typically calculated as:

**Revenue per available desk (or workstation) = Total revenue over a period ÷ Average number of available desks/workstations (capacity) during that period**  
(often expressed per month or per year).

It’s used in flexible office/coworking to measure monetization of capacity (similar in spirit to hotel “RevPAR,” but per desk).
