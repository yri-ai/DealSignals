1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
**Occupancy rate** (in the WeWork context) generally refers to the percentage of available desks/workstations (or sometimes revenue-capable space) that are occupied by members/tenants at a given time—i.e., utilization of the company’s capacity.

**Trend:** I don’t have reliable information about the specific occupancy-rate trend for WeWork around the 2021 BowX SPAC merger (e.g., exact levels or quarter-by-quarter movement) from my training knowledge.

2) **Confidence level:** **MEDIUM** on the definition; **LOW** on the trend (no reliable specifics available).

3) **General vs. WeWork/BowX-specific:**  
- Definition: **General knowledge**  
- Trend: **WeWork/BowX-specific** (and I don’t have reliable information)

**[Definition: HIGH, TRAINING] / [Trend: LOW, UNCERTAIN]**
