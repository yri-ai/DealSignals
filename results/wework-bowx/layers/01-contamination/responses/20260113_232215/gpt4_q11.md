**Answer:** Member churn rate is the percentage of members/customers who stop being members (cancel or do not renew) over a given period, typically calculated as:  
\[
\text{Churn rate} = \frac{\text{Members lost during period}}{\text{Members at start of period (or average members)}} \times 100\%
\]  
It’s used to measure customer retention; higher churn means more members are leaving.
