**Answer:** Total lease obligations are the aggregate future payments a company is contractually committed to make under its lease agreements (often operating leases and/or finance leases), typically shown as undiscounted minimum lease payments over future periods (e.g., due within 1 year, 2–5 years, beyond 5 years). Under modern accounting (ASC 842 / IFRS 16), related amounts are reflected via right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but “total lease obligations” often refers to the total remaining committed payments/disclosure, not necessarily the discounted balance-sheet liability.
