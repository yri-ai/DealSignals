I don’t have reliable information about the **duration profile of lease commitments** for WeWork in the context of the **2021 BowX SPAC merger** (e.g., the specific maturity buckets/weighted-average remaining lease term as disclosed in the deal materials).

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Note:** This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, not general knowledge
