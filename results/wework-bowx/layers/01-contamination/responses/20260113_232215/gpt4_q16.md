I don’t have reliable information about what specifically “happens to the business at 70% occupancy” in the context of the WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger materials (e.g., whether that was cited as a breakeven point, profitability threshold, cash-flow inflection, etc.).  
- Confidence: **LOW**  
- Source: **[UNCERTAIN]** (not reliably in my training knowledge; would be specific to the WeWork/BowX case)
