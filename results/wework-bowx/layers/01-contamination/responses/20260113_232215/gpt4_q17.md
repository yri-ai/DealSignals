I don’t have reliable information about this. **[LOW] [UNCERTAIN]**

- **Answer (from training knowledge):** I don’t recall a specific, authoritative statement from the WeWork–BowX 2021 merger materials (or related coverage) that defines what “happens to the business at 50% occupancy” (e.g., profitability break-even, cash flow turning positive/negative, or a specific operational outcome).  
- **Confidence:** **LOW**  
- **General vs. WeWork/BowX-specific:** This would be **WeWork/BowX-specific**, and I don’t have a reliable, case-specific fact to cite from my training knowledge.
