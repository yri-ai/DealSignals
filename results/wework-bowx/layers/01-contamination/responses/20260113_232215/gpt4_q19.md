1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
I don’t have reliable information about the specific **valuation methodology explicitly cited** in the WeWork–BowX 2021 SPAC merger materials to justify the transaction price.  

What I can say generally (not case-specific) is that SPAC merger presentations commonly justify price using a **public comps multiple approach** (e.g., EV/Revenue on forward-year projections) and sometimes a **DCF** based on management forecasts—but I can’t confirm which was used for WeWork–BowX without the actual documents.

2) **Confidence level:** **LOW**

3) **Note:** **General knowledge** (not specific confirmed details about the WeWork/BowX case)  
**Tag:** **[UNCERTAIN]**
