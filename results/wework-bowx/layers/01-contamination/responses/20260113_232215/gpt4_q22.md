**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
SoftBank (via SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund affiliates) was WeWork’s major controlling/anchor shareholder and sponsor prior to, and through, the 2021 SPAC merger with BowX. In the transaction, SoftBank-backed entities participated as significant sellers/recipients of proceeds and also agreed to governance/lock-up style restrictions typical for large holders. SoftBank also had (from its earlier rescue financing) ongoing financial ties to WeWork (e.g., financing arrangements and commitments), but I do **not** have reliable, specific detail from memory on the exact “ongoing obligations” terms (such as precise amounts, dates, or covenants) as defined in the BowX merger documents.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (high-level role), LOW (specific ongoing obligations)  
**Source tag:** [TRAINING] for general role; [UNCERTAIN] for specific obligations  
**Note:** Mix of general knowledge (SoftBank as major backer/controlling shareholder) and WeWork/BowX-case-specific elements (transaction participation/lock-ups), but I lack reliable specifics on the “ongoing obligations” without the filings.
