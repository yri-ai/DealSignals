I don’t have reliable information about the **top disclosed risk factors** as they were specifically listed/prioritized in the WeWork–BowX 2021 merger filings (e.g., the exact “Risk Factors” section headings and ordering in the proxy/registration statement). **[LOW] [UNCERTAIN]** — this would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, and I can’t recall the definitive list without the documents.

What I *can* say from general knowledge (not a verified “top disclosed” list from the filings) is that SPAC mergers involving WeWork at that time commonly emphasized risks such as: WeWork’s history of losses and need for liquidity, uncertainty in achieving profitability, lease obligations and exposure to long-term fixed costs, sensitivity to office demand/coworking trends (including COVID-19 impacts), ability to retain members and fill space, and competitive/real-estate market risks. **[MEDIUM] [TRAINING]** — **general knowledge**, not confirmed as the “top disclosed” risk factors list for the WeWork/BowX filings.
