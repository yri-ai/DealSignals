I don’t have reliable information about whether there were going concern disclosures in the WeWork–BowX SPAC merger disclosures/financial statements.  

- Confidence: **LOW**  
- Source: **[UNCERTAIN]**  
- Note: This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (depends on the exact SEC filings and the auditors’/management’s disclosures at the time).
