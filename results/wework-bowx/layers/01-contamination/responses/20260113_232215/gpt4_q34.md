I don’t have reliable information about the specific **registration rights that existed in the WeWork–BowX Acquisition Corp (2021) SPAC merger** (e.g., which holders had demand/piggyback rights, timing, shelf registration obligations, or any lock-up/registration interplay).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This is **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, and I can’t confirm details from my training knowledge.
