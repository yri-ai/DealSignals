**Answer (market context at deal time):**  
In early 2021 when WeWork agreed to merge with BowX Acquisition Corp, the broader market context was a very active SPAC environment—often described as the tail end of the 2020–early 2021 SPAC boom—with elevated investor risk appetite and strong equity market performance following the post-COVID stimulus-driven rally. Around that period, scrutiny and volatility in SPACs were also increasing (including more cautious sentiment and regulatory attention as 2021 progressed), which contributed to choppier trading for many de‑SPAC and SPAC-linked deals.

**Note (general vs specific):** Mix of general market knowledge (SPAC boom/shift in sentiment) and WeWork/BowX timing context; not a highly granular, deal-specific contemporaneous market recap.
