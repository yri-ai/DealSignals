I don’t have reliable information about a specific, disclosed “exit/refinancing strategy” for WeWork’s lease obligations in the context of the 2021 BowX SPAC merger.

What I can say from general knowledge is that companies with large operating lease portfolios typically address lease obligations through a mix of: renegotiating lease terms, obtaining rent concessions, exiting/terminating or assigning leases (often with landlord agreements), subleasing excess space, and (where applicable) restructuring processes. But I can’t confirm that this was the stated strategy in the WeWork/BowX transaction materials.
