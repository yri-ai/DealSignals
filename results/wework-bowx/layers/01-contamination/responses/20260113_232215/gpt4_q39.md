I don’t have reliable information about the specific **debt covenants and restrictions** that applied in the **WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger** context (e.g., the exact covenants in WeWork’s credit agreements/notes at that time, and any merger-related covenant amendments or waivers).

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source:** [UNCERTAIN] (I don’t have sufficiently detailed covenant text/terms from training data to answer accurately)

If you can share the relevant filing excerpt (e.g., WeWork/BowX proxy/registration statement sections describing debt terms, or the debt agreement), I can help summarize the covenants and restrictions precisely from that text.
