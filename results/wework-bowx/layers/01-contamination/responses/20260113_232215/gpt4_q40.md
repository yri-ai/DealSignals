I don’t have reliable information to give a definitive “would invest / would not invest” recommendation on the WeWork–BowX 2021 SPAC merger **based only on training knowledge**, because that decision depends on investor-specific factors (risk tolerance, time horizon, portfolio context) and requires up-to-date, complete financial/market information beyond what I can verify here.

- **Answer:** I don’t have reliable information about this to make an investment recommendation.  
- **Confidence:** **HIGH**  
- **Source tag:** **[TRAINING]**  
- **Note:** This is **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (the inability to recommend is due to missing reliable, complete, decision-relevant information in this context).
