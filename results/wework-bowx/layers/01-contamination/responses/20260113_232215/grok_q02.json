This reflects a decline in revenue during the period surrounding the SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, which was completed in October 2021.\n\n### Confidence Level\nMEDIUM (likely based on publicly reported financial data, but exact figures may vary slightly depending on sources).\n\n### Source Note\nTRAINING (this is general knowledge from pre-training data on WeWork's financial performance).",
