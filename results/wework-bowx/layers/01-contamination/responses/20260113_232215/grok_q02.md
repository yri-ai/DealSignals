### Answer
Based on my training knowledge, WeWork reported revenue of approximately $3.2 billion in 2020 and $2.8 billion in 2021, resulting in a year-over-year revenue growth rate of about -12.5% from 2020 to 2021. This reflects a decline in revenue during the period surrounding the SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, which was completed in October 2021.

### Confidence Level
MEDIUM (likely based on publicly reported financial data, but exact figures may vary slightly depending on sources).

### Source Note
TRAINING (this is general knowledge from pre-training data on WeWork's financial performance).
