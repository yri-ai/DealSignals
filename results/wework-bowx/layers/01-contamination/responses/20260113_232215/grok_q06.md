### Answer to Question: What is the path to profitability and timeline stated?

Based on my training knowledge, in the context of the WeWork merger with BowX Acquisition Corp (announced in October 2020 and completed in October 2021), WeWork's prospectus and related disclosures outlined a path to profitability that included operational efficiencies, cost reductions (such as streamlining real estate leases and reducing overhead), revenue growth through increased occupancy rates and expansion into new markets, and leveraging technology for better space utilization. The stated timeline was to achieve profitability by 2024, contingent on market conditions and execution of these strategies.

- **Confidence level:** HIGH (certain)
