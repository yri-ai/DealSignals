### Answer to Question: What are the key assumptions underlying the projections?

Based on my training knowledge, the financial projections in the WeWork-BowX Acquisition Corp merger (announced in October 2021) were outlined in the S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC. These projections were forward-looking and assumed significant growth in WeWork's business model, including membership expansion, revenue per member increases, and operational efficiencies. Key assumptions underlying these projections included:

- **Demand for flexible workspaces**: Continued strong global demand for WeWork's co-working and flexible office spaces, driven by trends like remote work and corporate cost-saving measures.
- **Membership growth**: Rapid expansion of community-adjusted memberships (e.g., from approximately 528,000 in 2020 to over 1 million by 2025), assuming successful marketing, retention strategies, and market penetration.
- **Revenue drivers**: Increases in revenue per member through upselling services (e.g., premium memberships, events, and enterprise solutions), with total revenue projected to reach around $10 billion by 2025.
- **Cost structure and profitability**: Achievement of positive adjusted EBITDA through cost reductions, lease optimizations (e.g., converting owned leases to revenue-generating assets), and operational efficiencies, despite historical losses.
- **Market and economic conditions**: No major economic downturns, regulatory changes, or competitive disruptions that could impede growth, and successful execution of international expansion plans.
- **Merger synergies**: Benefits from the SPAC merger, such as access to capital for investments and improved financial stability.

These assumptions were criticized by analysts and investors for being overly optimistic, as WeWork had a history of unprofitable operations and the merger was ultimately terminated in November 2021 due to valuation concerns and market conditions.

- **Confidence level**: MEDIUM (likely based on public filings and reports, but details may vary and are subject to interpretation).
- **Source note**: [TRAINING] – This is drawn from pre-training knowledge of public financial disclosures and news reports on the WeWork-BowX merger up to 2023. Specific to the WeWork/BowX case. If exact wording or additional details are needed, I recommend reviewing the original S-4 filing.
