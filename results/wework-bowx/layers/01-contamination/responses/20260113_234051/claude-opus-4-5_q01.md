**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's "most recent" revenue, as that depends on what time period you're asking about relative to my training data.

**What I do know [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]:**

From the SPAC merger period (2021), WeWork's revenue figures that were publicly discussed included:
- 2020 full-year revenue was approximately **$3.2 billion** (down from ~$3.5 billion in 2019, reflecting pandemic impact)
- The company was projecting revenue growth in their SPAC presentation materials for 2021 and beyond

However, I want to be clear about limitations:
- I don't have access to quarterly SEC filings or earnings reports that would give precise figures
- "Most recent" is ambiguous - if you mean Q2 2021 (around the merger), Q4 2021, or later periods, I cannot provide specific quarterly breakdowns with confidence
- WeWork's revenue was volatile during this period due to COVID-19 impacts and membership fluctuations

**If you have a specific document with revenue figures**, I would be better positioned to analyze and verify that information rather than relying on my potentially incomplete training knowledge.

Would you like to share the specific financial data you're working with?
