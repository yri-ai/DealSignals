**Answer:** I don't have reliable specific information about WeWork's exact year-over-year revenue growth rate at the time of the BowX SPAC merger.

**What I do recall [MEDIUM confidence, TRAINING]:**
- WeWork's revenue had been growing rapidly in the years leading up to its failed 2019 IPO
- The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted WeWork's business in 2020, likely causing revenue decline or stagnation
- By 2021 when the SPAC merger was announced, the company was in recovery mode

**General context [MEDIUM confidence, TRAINING]:**
- Pre-pandemic (2018-2019), WeWork had been reporting strong revenue growth, often cited in the range of 100%+ year-over-year
- The 2020-2021 period would have shown very different numbers due to pandemic impacts on flexible office space demand

**I cannot reliably state:**
- The specific YoY growth rate cited in the BowX merger materials
- Whether the projected forward growth rates from the SPAC presentation
- The exact revenue figures for 2020 vs 2021

**Recommendation:** For accurate revenue growth figures, you would need to reference the actual investor presentation or S-4 filing from the BowX/WeWork transaction, as I cannot confirm specific percentages with confidence.

[LOW confidence on specific numbers, UNCERTAIN]
