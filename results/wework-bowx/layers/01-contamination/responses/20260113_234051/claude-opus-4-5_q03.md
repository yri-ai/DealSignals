Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's financial situation around the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021:

**Answer:** WeWork reported significant operating losses. For the first half of 2021 (the period most relevant to the SPAC merger documents), operating losses were approximately **$1.5-1.7 billion**. For the full year 2020, operating losses were around **$3.2-3.5 billion**.

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is based on pre-training knowledge from financial reporting and coverage of the WeWork SPAC deal.

**Important caveats:**
- I don't have access to the specific SPAC merger documents or the exact figures from the S-4/proxy filings
- WeWork's financial reporting was complex and included various adjustments and non-GAAP metrics
- The company's definition of "operating loss" vs. "Adjusted EBITDA loss" vs. other metrics varied in their presentations
- I cannot verify the precise figures from the specific "most recent period" as defined in any particular document you may be reviewing

If you need exact figures from a specific filing or time period, I would recommend verifying against the actual SEC documents, as my recollection of precise numbers may not be accurate.
