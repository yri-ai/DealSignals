I don’t have reliable information about this.

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Scope note:** This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate depends on the exact period being referenced (e.g., FY2020 vs FY2019, 1H2021 vs 1H2020, etc.), which I can’t state reliably from my training knowledge without risking fabrication.
