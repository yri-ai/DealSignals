Based on my training knowledge about WeWork around the time of the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** WeWork had a significant cash burn rate, which was one of the major concerns raised during the SPAC merger process. From what I recall from the 2021 timeframe:

- WeWork was burning through approximately **$1-2 billion per year** in cash
- The company had been working to reduce this from even higher levels seen during the 2019 failed IPO period
- The SPAC merger documents indicated WeWork was targeting a path to profitability, but the cash burn remained substantial

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is based on general knowledge from coverage of the WeWork/BowX merger, but I want to be transparent that the specific quarterly or monthly burn rate figures may have varied, and I don't have precise figures from the merger prospectus committed to memory.

**Important caveat:** Cash burn rates for WeWork fluctuated significantly based on expansion/contraction activities, COVID-19 impacts on occupancy, and restructuring efforts. If you need precise figures for analysis, I'd recommend verifying against the actual S-4/proxy filings from the merger.
