**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about this specific metric.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**Explanation:** Cash runway calculations require knowing:
1. The specific cash/liquidity position at a point in time
2. The current cash burn rate at that same point

While I have general knowledge that WeWork was burning significant cash leading up to and after the SPAC merger (the company was known for substantial operating losses), I cannot provide a specific cash runway figure because:

- Cash positions fluctuated significantly throughout 2021
- Burn rates varied quarter to quarter
- The SPAC merger itself was expected to provide approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds (from PIPE and trust), which would have affected runway calculations
- I don't have precise figures memorized for a specific reporting date

What I can say with **MEDIUM confidence** [TRAINING]: WeWork's cash burn and liquidity concerns were well-documented issues that were central to investor discussions around the SPAC merger. The company needed the capital infusion from the BowX deal in part to extend its operational runway.

If you need the specific runway figure, I'd recommend checking the S-4 filing or investor presentation from the merger, which would have contained these projections.
