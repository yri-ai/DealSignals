Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

WeWork projected reaching profitability (Adjusted EBITDA positive) by **2024**. In their investor presentations during the SPAC merger process, they outlined a path to profitability that included:

1. **Cost reduction** - Significant cuts to operating expenses and corporate overhead that had already begun under Sandeep Mathrani's leadership
2. **Portfolio optimization** - Exiting underperforming locations and renegotiating lease terms
3. **Improved unit economics** - Targeting higher occupancy rates and revenue per member
4. **Reduced capital expenditure** - Less aggressive expansion compared to the pre-IPO era

They indicated they expected to reach **positive Adjusted EBITDA sometime in 2024**, with continued improvement thereafter.

**Important caveats:**
- I'm less certain about the specific quarterly targets or exact financial milestones they committed to
- The projections were based on assumptions about occupancy recovery post-COVID
- I don't have high confidence in the specific numeric targets (margin percentages, exact EBITDA figures by year)

**What I'm uncertain about:**
- The precise year-by-year EBITDA projections from the S-4/investor deck
- Whether they specified GAAP profitability timeline vs. just Adjusted EBITDA
- Specific occupancy rate targets tied to the profitability timeline

Would you like me to clarify what I do or don't know about any specific aspect of their stated path to profitability?
