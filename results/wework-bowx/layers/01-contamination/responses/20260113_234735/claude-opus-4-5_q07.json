  "content": "# Key Assumptions Underlying WeWork/BowX SPAC Projections\n\n**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**\n\nBased on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, the projections presented to investors relied on several key assumptions:\n\n## Revenue & Growth Assumptions\n- **Membership growth**: Significant increases in enterprise and individual memberships over the projection period\n- **Revenue per membership**: Assumptions about maintaining or increasing average revenue per desk/member\n- **Geographic expansion**: Continued international growth, particularly in high-growth markets\n\n## Operational Assumptions\n- **Occupancy rates**: Projections assumed improving occupancy rates toward 70-80%+ levels as pandemic effects subsided\n- **Contribution margin improvement**: Expectations that mature locations would achieve positive contribution margins\n- **Operating leverage**: Assumptions that fixed costs would be spread across a larger revenue base over time\n\n## Market Assumptions\n- **Flexible workspace demand**: Belief that hybrid/flexible work trends would accelerate post-COVID\n- **Enterprise adoption**: Growing share of revenue from larger corporate clients (seen as more stable)\n\n## What I'm UNCERTAIN About\nI don't have reliable, specific information about:\n- The exact numerical assumptions (specific occupancy %, growth rates)\n- The precise timeline for profitability targets\n- Detailed lease liability assumptions\n- Specific discount rates or terminal values used\n\n---\n\n**Important caveat**: SPAC projections were notoriously optimistic during this period, and WeWork's actual performance significantly underperformed these projections. The assumptions were later viewed by many analysts as overly aggressive.",
