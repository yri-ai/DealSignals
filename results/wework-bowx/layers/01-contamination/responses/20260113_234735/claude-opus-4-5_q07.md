# Key Assumptions Underlying WeWork/BowX SPAC Projections

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, the projections presented to investors relied on several key assumptions:

## Revenue & Growth Assumptions
- **Membership growth**: Significant increases in enterprise and individual memberships over the projection period
- **Revenue per membership**: Assumptions about maintaining or increasing average revenue per desk/member
- **Geographic expansion**: Continued international growth, particularly in high-growth markets

## Operational Assumptions
- **Occupancy rates**: Projections assumed improving occupancy rates toward 70-80%+ levels as pandemic effects subsided
- **Contribution margin improvement**: Expectations that mature locations would achieve positive contribution margins
- **Operating leverage**: Assumptions that fixed costs would be spread across a larger revenue base over time

## Market Assumptions
- **Flexible workspace demand**: Belief that hybrid/flexible work trends would accelerate post-COVID
- **Enterprise adoption**: Growing share of revenue from larger corporate clients (seen as more stable)

## What I'm UNCERTAIN About
I don't have reliable, specific information about:
- The exact numerical assumptions (specific occupancy %, growth rates)
- The precise timeline for profitability targets
- Detailed lease liability assumptions
- Specific discount rates or terminal values used

**Important caveat**: SPAC projections were notoriously optimistic during this period, and WeWork's actual performance significantly underperformed these projections. The assumptions were later viewed by many analysts as overly aggressive.
