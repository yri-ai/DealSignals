**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific revenue per available desk/workstation metric from the BowX merger materials.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**What I can offer as context:**

Revenue per available desk (or workstation) is a key operational metric in the flexible workspace industry - similar to "RevPAR" (Revenue Per Available Room) in hospitality. It's calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of desks/workstations available for rent, regardless of occupancy.

However, I don't have reliable recall of:
- The specific figure WeWork disclosed in their SPAC presentation
- Whether they used "desk" or "workstation" or "membership" as their unit
- The exact methodology they applied

WeWork did report various operational metrics in their investor materials, but I cannot confidently cite the specific revenue per desk figure without risking fabrication.

If you have the source document, I'd be happy to help analyze or contextualize the actual figure.
