# Occupancy Rate Analysis for WeWork

## Definition
**Occupancy rate** refers to the percentage of WeWork's available desk/workstation capacity that is actually occupied by paying members. It's a critical operational metric for flexible workspace providers.

## Trend Analysis

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

Based on my training knowledge:

### Pre-Pandemic (2019)
- WeWork's occupancy rates were generally in the **70-80% range** for mature locations
- Newer locations typically had lower occupancy as they ramped up

### COVID-19 Impact (2020)
- Occupancy plummeted significantly due to:
  - Remote work mandates
  - Enterprise clients reducing footprints
  - Membership cancellations/pauses
- Rates dropped well below historical norms

### Recovery Period (2021 - SPAC Merger Period)
- Occupancy was recovering but remained **below pre-pandemic levels**
- The company highlighted improving trends in SPAC presentation materials
- Physical occupancy was further impacted by hybrid work patterns

## Important Caveats

**[UNCERTAIN]** on specific numerical figures:
- I don't have reliable information on the exact occupancy percentages cited in the BowX merger documents
- The company may have used different occupancy metrics (physical vs. economic occupancy)

## Why This Metric Matters

For WeWork specifically, occupancy rate directly impacts:
1. Revenue per available desk
2. Operating leverage and path to profitability
3. Ability to cover fixed lease obligations

*I'd recommend verifying specific occupancy figures from the actual S-4 filing or investor presentations, as I cannot confirm precise numbers with high confidence.*
