**Answer:** Member churn rate is the percentage of members (customers/tenants) who leave or cancel their memberships over a given period of time. It's a standard SaaS/subscription business metric that measures customer attrition.

**In the context of WeWork specifically:** Churn rate would measure what percentage of their flexible workspace members (companies or individuals renting desk space, offices, etc.) discontinue their memberships within a specific timeframe (typically monthly or annually).

**Formula:** Churn Rate = (Members Lost During Period ÷ Members at Start of Period) × 100

**Why it matters for WeWork:** High churn is particularly problematic for WeWork because:
- They have long-term lease obligations to landlords
- But shorter-term, flexible commitments from members
- This creates a mismatch between fixed costs and variable revenue
- Higher churn = more revenue volatility and risk

**Confidence Level:** [HIGH]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is general business/finance knowledge about subscription metrics, combined with general knowledge about WeWork's business model from my training data. The definition of churn rate is standard across the industry.

*Note: I do not have specific recall of the exact churn rate figures that were disclosed or projected during the BowX SPAC merger process. If you need those specific numbers, I would need to see the source documents.*
