**Answer:** I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific average revenue per member figure.

**Confidence:** LOW

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN]

**Explanation:** While I have general knowledge about WeWork's business model and the BowX SPAC merger in 2021, I don't have confident recall of the specific average revenue per member metric. This is a precise financial KPI that would have been disclosed in investor presentations or SEC filings, but I cannot reliably state the exact figure without risking providing inaccurate information.

What I can say with more confidence is that WeWork's revenue model was based on membership fees for flexible workspace, and metrics like revenue per member would vary by:
- Geographic market (US vs. international)
- Membership type (hot desk vs. dedicated desk vs. private office)
- Time period being measured

If you have access to the actual investor presentation or S-4 filing from the BowX merger, I'd recommend referencing those documents for the precise figure.
