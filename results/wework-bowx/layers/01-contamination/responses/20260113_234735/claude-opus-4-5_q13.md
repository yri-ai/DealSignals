Based on my training knowledge regarding WeWork's financial situation around the time of the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** WeWork had substantial total lease obligations, which were one of the most significant liabilities on their balance sheet. At the time of the SPAC merger in 2021, WeWork's total lease obligations were in the range of **approximately $15-18 billion** in future minimum lease payments (undiscounted). This represented commitments for their extensive portfolio of leased real estate across hundreds of locations globally.

These lease obligations were a critical factor in WeWork's financial analysis because:
- They represented long-term fixed commitments regardless of occupancy/revenue
- The mismatch between long-term lease commitments and shorter-term member agreements created significant risk
- Under ASC 842, a large portion appeared as operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - I have general knowledge about WeWork's lease-heavy business model and that lease obligations were a major financial concern discussed extensively in their disclosures. However, I am not certain of the precise dollar figure at the exact time of the merger closing, and the total could vary depending on whether you're measuring:
- Undiscounted future minimum payments
- Present value of lease liabilities
- Including/excluding renewal options

For the exact figure as disclosed in the S-4 or merger proxy materials, I would recommend verifying against the actual filing documents.
