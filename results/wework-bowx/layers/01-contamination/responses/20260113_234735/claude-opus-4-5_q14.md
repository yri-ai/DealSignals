Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model and the SPAC merger context:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

WeWork's lease commitments were characterized by a significant **duration mismatch** that was a core business risk:

- **WeWork's lease obligations:** Typically **10-15 year** long-term leases with landlords (fixed, non-cancellable commitments)
- **Member agreements:** Typically **month-to-month or 1-2 year** terms with enterprise and individual members

This mismatch meant WeWork was locked into long-term payment obligations while revenue could fluctuate significantly based on shorter-term member demand.

At the time of the BowX merger, WeWork had disclosed **tens of billions of dollars** in future lease obligations extending out over the next decade-plus. I recall figures in the range of **$45-50 billion** in total future minimum lease commitments, though I'm not certain of the exact figure disclosed in the SPAC merger documents.

**Caveat:** I don't have reliable information about the precise breakdown by year or the exact figures disclosed in the BowX merger proxy/S-4 documents. The specific duration profile (e.g., how much was due in years 1-5 vs. 6-10 vs. 10+) would require the actual filing to confirm accurately.

If you need exact figures, I'd recommend reviewing the merger prospectus or WeWork's 10-K filings from that period.
