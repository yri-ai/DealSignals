## Answer

**Confidence: LOW**
**Source: UNCERTAIN**

I don't have reliable specific information about the detailed lease termination provisions in WeWork's lease agreements as disclosed in the BowX SPAC merger documents.

### What I Know Generally (TRAINING, MEDIUM confidence):

WeWork's business model was built on long-term lease obligations (typically 10-15 year master leases) with landlords, which was a major financial risk factor discussed extensively during the SPAC merger. Key general points:

- WeWork had **substantial long-term lease commitments** that were a major liability
- The company had been working to negotiate **more flexible lease structures** following the failed 2019 IPO
- Some leases included **early termination clauses** tied to performance metrics
- SoftBank's rescue package involved renegotiating certain lease terms

### What I Cannot Reliably Provide:

- Specific termination notice periods
- Exact penalty structures or fees
- Building-by-building termination rights
- The precise terms disclosed in the S-4/proxy materials for the BowX merger

**Recommendation:** For accurate lease termination provisions, you would need to review WeWork's actual SEC filings, particularly the S-4 registration statement for the BowX merger and subsequent 10-K filings which would detail material lease obligations and terms.
