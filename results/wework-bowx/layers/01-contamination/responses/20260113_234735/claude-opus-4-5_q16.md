Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

At approximately 70% occupancy, WeWork's flexible workspace business model was generally expected to reach **breakeven or become cash flow positive** at the individual location level. This was a commonly cited threshold in WeWork's financial discussions leading up to and during the SPAC merger period.

The logic was:
- Below ~70% occupancy: Locations typically operated at a loss due to fixed costs (rent, buildout, overhead)
- At/above ~70% occupancy: Contribution margins become positive, allowing locations to cover their costs and contribute to overall profitability

**Important caveats:**
- This threshold varied by market and specific location economics
- This was a location-level metric, not a company-wide profitability threshold
- WeWork's overall path to profitability depended on many other factors including corporate overhead, expansion costs, and lease obligations

I don't have specific recall of the exact language used in the BowX merger documents themselves regarding this metric, so I cannot confirm the precise framing or context in which this was presented to investors during that transaction.
