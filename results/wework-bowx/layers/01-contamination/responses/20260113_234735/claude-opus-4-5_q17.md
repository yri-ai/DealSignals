Based on my training knowledge about WeWork's business model and the information disclosed during the BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** At 50% occupancy, WeWork's locations typically operate at or near breakeven or at a loss. The company's business model requires significantly higher occupancy rates to generate meaningful profits due to:

1. **High fixed costs** - Long-term lease obligations, buildout costs, and operational overhead remain constant regardless of occupancy
2. **Unit economics** - WeWork's S-1 filings and SPAC presentation materials indicated that locations generally needed 70-80%+ occupancy to achieve healthy margins
3. **Contribution margin dynamics** - At 50% occupancy, revenue covers basic operating costs but leaves little margin after accounting for lease payments

During the BowX merger discussions, WeWork projected improvements in occupancy from pandemic lows (which had dropped significantly below 50% in many markets) as a key driver of the path to profitability.

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This is based on general knowledge from WeWork's public disclosures, the failed 2019 IPO documentation, and coverage of the 2021 SPAC merger. However, I don't have access to the specific breakeven occupancy thresholds from the BowX investor presentation, so the exact 50% occupancy implications may have been stated differently in those materials.

If you need the precise language from the BowX merger documents regarding 50% occupancy scenarios, I would recommend consulting the actual SEC filings or investor presentation directly.
