Based on my training knowledge:

The implied enterprise value for WeWork in the BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger was approximately **$9 billion**.

**Confidence:** [HIGH]

**Source:** [TRAINING]

This figure was widely reported at the time of the merger announcement in March 2021. It's worth noting that this represented a dramatic reduction from WeWork's peak private valuation of $47 billion in 2019, prior to the failed IPO attempt. The $9 billion enterprise value reflected the significant reassessment of WeWork's business model and prospects following the governance and financial concerns that emerged in 2019.
