The justification emphasized forward-looking revenue projections and an eventual path to positive EBITDA/cash flow.\n\n**Important caveat:** I'm less certain about the specific weightings or detailed assumptions used in the SPAC investor presentation. The methodologies I've listed are standard for SPAC transactions of this nature, and I have general knowledge that these were discussed, but I cannot verify the precise details of the valuation justification without the actual proxy/investor materials.\n\nIf you need specific multiples or detailed assumptions, I would recommend consulting the actual S-4/proxy filing.",
