Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

The valuation methodology used to justify WeWork's price in the BowX SPAC merger primarily relied on:

1. **Enterprise Value/Revenue multiples** - comparing WeWork to other real estate and tech-enabled companies, though this was complicated by WeWork's lack of profitability

2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis** - projecting future cash flows based on management's growth assumptions and path to profitability

3. **Sum-of-the-parts analysis** - valuing different geographic segments and business lines separately

4. **Comparable company analysis** - benchmarking against flexible workspace competitors (IWG/Regus) and tech-enabled real estate platforms

The deal valued WeWork at approximately **$9 billion enterprise value**, which was notably a significant markdown from the ~$47 billion valuation in the failed 2019 IPO attempt. The justification emphasized forward-looking revenue projections and an eventual path to positive EBITDA/cash flow.

**Important caveat:** I'm less certain about the specific weightings or detailed assumptions used in the SPAC investor presentation. The methodologies I've listed are standard for SPAC transactions of this nature, and I have general knowledge that these were discussed, but I cannot verify the precise details of the valuation justification without the actual proxy/investor materials.

If you need specific multiples or detailed assumptions, I would recommend consulting the actual S-4/proxy filing.
