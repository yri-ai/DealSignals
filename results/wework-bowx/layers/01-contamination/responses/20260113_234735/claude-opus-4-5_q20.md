Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about comparable transactions and companies that would have been relevant to the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger valuation context:

## Comparable Transactions/Companies Likely Cited

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

In the flexible workspace/coworking sector, typical comparables would have included:

1. **IWG plc (Regus)** - The most direct public comparable as the largest global flexible workspace provider

2. **Other 2020-2021 SPAC transactions** in real estate/proptech space, though I don't have specific ones cited in the WeWork deal documents

3. **Earlier WeWork valuations** - The company's own prior private valuations ($47B peak in 2019, then marked down significantly)

## What I'm Less Certain About

**[LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]**

I don't have reliable information about:
- The **specific comparable companies** listed in the BowX investor presentation or proxy materials
- Exact **comparable transaction multiples** used by the bankers
- Whether they used **SaaS/tech comparables** versus traditional real estate comparables (this was a point of controversy in WeWork's original IPO attempt)

## Honest Assessment

I don't have reliable information about the specific comparables cited in the actual BowX/WeWork merger documents. My knowledge includes the general context that valuation methodology for WeWork was contentious, but I cannot cite the precise comparable transactions or companies from the deal materials without risking fabrication.

Would you like me to explain what comparables *typically* would be used for this type of transaction instead?
