# Key Executives in the WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

## WeWork Leadership

**Sandeep Mathrani - CEO**
- [HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]
- Joined WeWork as CEO in February 2020, brought in to stabilize the company post-IPO collapse
- Previously CEO of Brookfield Properties' retail group and GGP Inc. (major mall operator)
- Track record: Highly regarded real estate executive with decades of commercial real estate experience
- Known for operational turnarounds and cost discipline

**Adam Neumann - Co-Founder (no longer executive)**
- [HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]
- Departed as CEO in 2019 amid the failed IPO
- Controversial track record: built WeWork to massive scale but criticized for governance failures, self-dealing, and unsustainable growth strategy

## BowX Acquisition Corp Leadership

**Vivek Ranadivé - Chairman/CEO of BowX**
- [HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]
- Owner of the Sacramento Kings NBA team
- Founder of TIBCO Software
- Tech entrepreneur background

**I have MEDIUM confidence on the following:**

- Ranadivé had prior SPAC experience, but I'm less certain of specific details

## What I'm Less Certain About

[UNCERTAIN] - Specific details about other BowX board members or the complete WeWork C-suite at the time of the merger announcement. I know there were other executives involved but cannot reliably name them all without risk of error.
