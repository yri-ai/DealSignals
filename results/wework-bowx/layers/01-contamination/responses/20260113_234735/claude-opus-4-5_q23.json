This was a significant governance concern that drew scrutiny during the failed 2019 IPO.\n\n2. **\"We\" Trademark Transaction** - Neumann personally owned the \"We\" trademark and WeWork paid approximately $5.9 million to license it back (this was later reversed after public backlash).\n\n3. **Loans to Executives** - The company had extended substantial loans to executives, including to Neumann.\n\n4. **Neumann Family Involvement** - Rebekah Neumann had roles within the company and related entities.\n\n### What I'm Less Certain About:\n\n- **Specific related-party disclosures in the 2021 BowX merger proxy** - I don't have reliable detailed information about what specific related-party transactions were disclosed in the SPAC merger documents specifically.\n\n- **Post-Neumann related-party arrangements** - My knowledge of arrangements under the Sandeep Mathrani leadership period is less detailed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The high-profile related-party issues were primarily associated with the Neumann era and were substantially addressed before the SPAC merger. For specific disclosures in the BowX transaction documents, I would need to acknowledge uncertainty about the precise details.",
