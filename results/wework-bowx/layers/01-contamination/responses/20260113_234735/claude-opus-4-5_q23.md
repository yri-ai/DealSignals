Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about related-party transactions in the WeWork/BowX context:

## Related-Party Transactions

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

From my pre-training knowledge, I recall several categories of related-party transactions involving WeWork:

### Known Related-Party Arrangements:

1. **Adam Neumann's Property Dealings** - WeWork leased properties owned by or connected to its former CEO Adam Neumann. This was a significant governance concern that drew scrutiny during the failed 2019 IPO.

2. **"We" Trademark Transaction** - Neumann personally owned the "We" trademark and WeWork paid approximately $5.9 million to license it back (this was later reversed after public backlash).

3. **Loans to Executives** - The company had extended substantial loans to executives, including to Neumann.

4. **Neumann Family Involvement** - Rebekah Neumann had roles within the company and related entities.

### What I'm Less Certain About:

- **Specific related-party disclosures in the 2021 BowX merger proxy** - I don't have reliable detailed information about what specific related-party transactions were disclosed in the SPAC merger documents specifically.

- **Post-Neumann related-party arrangements** - My knowledge of arrangements under the Sandeep Mathrani leadership period is less detailed.

**Note:** The high-profile related-party issues were primarily associated with the Neumann era and were substantially addressed before the SPAC merger. For specific disclosures in the BowX transaction documents, I would need to acknowledge uncertainty about the precise details.
