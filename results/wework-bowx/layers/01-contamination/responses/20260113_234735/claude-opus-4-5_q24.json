He retained some equity but was no longer in an executive compensation role.\n\n2. **Sandeep Mathrani as CEO**: Sandeep Mathrani was serving as CEO at the time of the SPAC deal. Executive compensation packages in SPAC mergers typically include:\n   - Base salary\n   - Equity grants that vest over time\n   - Performance-based incentives tied to stock price or operational metrics\n\n3. **Sponsor economics (BowX side)**: Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 and the BowX sponsor team would have held founder shares (typically 20% of SPAC shares, known as \"promote\"), which create significant incentives for deal completion.\n\n**What I'm uncertain about:**\n\n- Specific dollar amounts or equity percentages for WeWork executives\n- Exact vesting schedules or performance hurdles\n- Details of any earnout provisions for management\n\n**I don't have reliable information about** the specific compensation terms, employment agreements, or detailed incentive structures disclosed in the proxy statement/S-4 filing for this particular transaction.\n\nWould you like me to explain what typical SPAC management incentive structures look like in general terms?",
