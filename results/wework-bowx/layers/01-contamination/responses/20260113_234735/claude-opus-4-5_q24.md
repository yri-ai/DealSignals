Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about management incentives in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger, though with varying confidence levels.

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

**What I know:**

1. **Adam Neumann's reduced role**: By the time of the 2021 SPAC merger, Adam Neumann had already been ousted as CEO (in 2019) and his compensation/control had been significantly restructured as part of SoftBank's bailout. He retained some equity but was no longer in an executive compensation role.

2. **Sandeep Mathrani as CEO**: Sandeep Mathrani was serving as CEO at the time of the SPAC deal. Executive compensation packages in SPAC mergers typically include:
   - Base salary
   - Equity grants that vest over time
   - Performance-based incentives tied to stock price or operational metrics

3. **Sponsor economics (BowX side)**: Vivek Ranadivé and the BowX sponsor team would have held founder shares (typically 20% of SPAC shares, known as "promote"), which create significant incentives for deal completion.

**What I'm uncertain about:**

- Specific dollar amounts or equity percentages for WeWork executives
- Exact vesting schedules or performance hurdles
- Details of any earnout provisions for management

**I don't have reliable information about** the specific compensation terms, employment agreements, or detailed incentive structures disclosed in the proxy statement/S-4 filing for this particular transaction.

Would you like me to explain what typical SPAC management incentive structures look like in general terms?
