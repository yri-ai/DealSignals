He was expected to remain a shareholder post-SPAC merger\n\n3. **Voting Rights Reduced**: As part of his departure in 2019, his supervoting shares were eliminated or converted, meaning he no longer had outsized control over company decisions\n\n4. **Non-Compete and Consulting**: I believe there was an initial consulting arrangement and non-compete agreement from his 2019 exit, though I'm uncertain of the specific terms or duration\n\n5. **SoftBank Settlement**: There was litigation between Neumann and SoftBank regarding a failed tender offer, which I believe was settled, but I'm uncertain of the exact timing relative to the SPAC merger\n\n**What I'm less certain about:**\n- The exact percentage of his remaining stake at SPAC close\n- Specific contractual restrictions that survived to 2021\n- Whether he had any board observer rights or similar ongoing connections\n\nI don't have reliable information about the precise dollar value of his exposure or exact share count at the time of the merger.",
