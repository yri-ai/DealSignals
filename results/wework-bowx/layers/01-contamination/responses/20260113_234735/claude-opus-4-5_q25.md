Based on my training knowledge:

**Adam Neumann's Ongoing Relationship/Exposure to WeWork (as of the 2021 SPAC merger period):**

[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

From what I know:

1. **Significantly Reduced Role**: After his ouster as CEO in 2019, Neumann had no operational role in WeWork by the time of the BowX merger

2. **Retained Economic Interest**: He maintained a substantial equity stake in WeWork, though his holdings were significantly diluted from their peak. He was expected to remain a shareholder post-SPAC merger

3. **Voting Rights Reduced**: As part of his departure in 2019, his supervoting shares were eliminated or converted, meaning he no longer had outsized control over company decisions

4. **Non-Compete and Consulting**: I believe there was an initial consulting arrangement and non-compete agreement from his 2019 exit, though I'm uncertain of the specific terms or duration

5. **SoftBank Settlement**: There was litigation between Neumann and SoftBank regarding a failed tender offer, which I believe was settled, but I'm uncertain of the exact timing relative to the SPAC merger

**What I'm less certain about:**
- The exact percentage of his remaining stake at SPAC close
- Specific contractual restrictions that survived to 2021
- Whether he had any board observer rights or similar ongoing connections

I don't have reliable information about the precise dollar value of his exposure or exact share count at the time of the merger.
