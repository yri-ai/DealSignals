# Top Disclosed Risk Factors - WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge of the WeWork SPAC merger and typical S-4/proxy filings for this transaction, the key disclosed risk factors included:

## Primary Risk Factors

1. **History of Significant Losses** - WeWork had never achieved profitability and had accumulated substantial losses (billions in net losses annually)

2. **Going Concern Uncertainties** - Questions about the company's ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital

3. **COVID-19 Impact** - Significant disruption to demand for flexible office space; occupancy rates declined materially

4. **Long-term Lease Obligations vs. Short-term Revenue Model** - Structural mismatch between WeWork's long-term lease commitments and member agreements that were shorter-term

5. **Dependence on Key Markets** - Heavy concentration in major metropolitan areas (NYC, London, etc.)

6. **Competition** - Increasing competition in flexible workspace sector

7. **Execution of Turnaround Plan** - Risks associated with cost-cutting measures and operational restructuring under new leadership

8. **Membership Churn and Renewal Risk** - Uncertainty around member retention

**Caveat:** I am reasonably confident these themes were prominent in the disclosure documents, but I cannot verify the exact ordering or precise language used in the S-4 filing without access to the actual document. There may have been additional material risk factors I'm not recalling.
