Based on my training knowledge regarding the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger:

## Material Litigation and Disputes

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

Yes, there were several material litigation matters and disputes involving WeWork around the time of the SPAC merger:

### Pre-Merger Legacy Issues:
1. **SoftBank Tender Offer Dispute** - WeWork and Adam Neumann had litigation with SoftBank over a cancelled $3 billion tender offer from 2019 that SoftBank withdrew in 2020. This was settled in early 2021 before the SPAC merger closed.

2. **Securities Class Actions** - Following the failed 2019 IPO, there were shareholder lawsuits related to alleged misrepresentations in the S-1 filing.

3. **Lease Disputes** - WeWork was involved in various landlord disputes and lease renegotiations, particularly as it tried to exit unfavorable long-term leases.

### Disclosed Risk Factors:
The SPAC merger documents would have disclosed ongoing litigation as risk factors, though I don't have specific details on all matters disclosed in the proxy/prospectus.

**What I'm Less Certain About [LOW confidence]:**
- The exact number or dollar amounts of pending litigation at merger close
- Specific outcomes of all legacy disputes
- Whether there were any merger-specific objection lawsuits (common in SPAC deals)

I don't have reliable information about the complete litigation docket or all material disputes that may have been disclosed in the definitive proxy statement.
