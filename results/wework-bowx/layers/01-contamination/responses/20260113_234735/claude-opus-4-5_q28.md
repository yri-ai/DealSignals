Based on my training knowledge, I can address this question.

**Answer:** Yes, WeWork had going concern disclosures.

**[HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]**

WeWork's financial statements included going concern warnings, which became a significant issue during and after the SPAC merger process. This is well-documented from my training data:

1. **Pre-merger concerns:** WeWork's massive operating losses and cash burn rate raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, which auditors flagged in financial filings.

2. **Post-merger disclosures:** After becoming a public company through the BowX merger (closing in October 2021), WeWork's subsequent SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q reports) contained going concern language from its independent auditors.

3. **Recurring theme:** The going concern disclosures reflected WeWork's persistent challenges - significant accumulated deficits, negative cash flows from operations, and reliance on external financing to fund operations.

This information was material to investors and was disclosed in the merger proxy materials as well as subsequent public filings. The going concern issue was a known risk factor that was part of the public record surrounding the SPAC transaction.

**Note:** The specific language and timing of particular going concern disclosures in individual filings would require document review to confirm exact details.
