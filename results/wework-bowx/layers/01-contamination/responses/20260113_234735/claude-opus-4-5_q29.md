**Answer:** [LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]

I don't have reliable specific information about what auditors said in connection with the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger.

**What I can say with more confidence:**

- WeWork's auditors (Ernst & Young) had previously issued a "going concern" warning in WeWork's financials around the time of the failed 2019 IPO attempt, expressing doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern
- Going concern warnings are significant auditor statements that indicate uncertainty about a company's financial viability

**What I'm uncertain about:**

- The specific auditor statements or opinions issued in connection with the 2021 SPAC merger documents
- Whether there were any updated going concern warnings, qualified opinions, or other notable auditor communications specifically tied to the BowX transaction
- The exact language or findings in audit reports filed with the SPAC merger proxy/registration statements

**Recommendation:** To get the precise auditor language, you would need to review the S-4 registration statement and related SEC filings, which would contain the auditor's report and any management discussion of audit findings.

I'd rather acknowledge this gap than provide potentially inaccurate specifics about auditor communications.
