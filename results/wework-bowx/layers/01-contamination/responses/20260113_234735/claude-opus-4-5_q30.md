Based on my training knowledge, I can address this question:

**Answer:** Yes, WeWork disclosed material weaknesses in internal controls.

**[MEDIUM-HIGH confidence] [TRAINING]**

From what I recall from my training data:

1. **Disclosed Material Weaknesses:** WeWork acknowledged material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in its SEC filings related to the SPAC merger. This was a notable disclosure in the registration statement/proxy materials.

2. **Nature of Weaknesses:** The material weaknesses related to:
   - Insufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel with appropriate technical expertise
   - Inadequate controls over the financial statement close process
   - Issues with information technology general controls

3. **Remediation Efforts:** The company indicated it was taking steps to remediate these weaknesses, including hiring additional accounting staff and implementing improved processes.

4. **Context:** This was significant because material weaknesses raise concerns about the reliability of financial statements and are a red flag for investors. For a company going public via SPAC, this disclosure was an important risk factor.

**Caveat:** I am confident material weaknesses were disclosed, but I may not have the complete or precise list of all specific weaknesses identified. The exact language and full scope would require reviewing the actual SEC filings (S-4, proxy statement, or subsequent 10-K filings).

This was publicly reported information at the time of the merger and in subsequent filings after WeWork became a public company.
