**Answer:** I don't have reliable detailed information about the specific board composition of WeWork following the BowX SPAC merger completion.

**What I can say with some confidence:**
- Sandeep Mathrani, who was WeWork's CEO at the time of the merger, would have remained in a leadership role
- Vivek Ranadivé, founder of BowX Acquisition Corp, likely had some board involvement given his role as SPAC sponsor
- SoftBank, as the largest shareholder, likely retained board representation
- The board would have been reconstituted as part of the merger to reflect the new public company structure

**What I cannot reliably confirm:**
- The exact number of board seats
- Full list of individual board members
- Committee structures
- Independence classifications of directors
- Whether any WeWork legacy board members (from the post-Adam Neumann restructuring) remained

**Confidence Level:** [LOW]

**Source:** [UNCERTAIN] - I have general knowledge about SPAC merger governance structures and some knowledge of WeWork's leadership at the time, but I do not have specific, reliable information about the exact post-merger board composition from my training data.

I would recommend consulting the company's definitive proxy statement or the merger closing 8-K filing for accurate board composition details.
