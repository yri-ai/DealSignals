**Answer:** I don't have reliable specific information about the detailed voting structure of WeWork post-merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.

**What I know with some confidence [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]:**
- The merger closed in October 2021, with WeWork becoming a publicly traded company on the NYSE under ticker "WE"
- Adam Neumann had previously held super-voting shares at WeWork (10:1 or 20:1 voting rights) prior to his departure in 2019
- As part of SoftBank's bailout and subsequent restructuring, Neumann's voting control was significantly reduced

**What I'm uncertain about [LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]:**
- The precise voting structure established in the SPAC merger documents
- Whether any dual-class share structure was implemented post-merger
- The specific voting rights allocated to different shareholder classes (SoftBank, public shareholders, management)

**My assessment:** SPAC mergers typically result in a simpler, single-class common stock structure, but I cannot confirm this was the case for WeWork without access to the actual merger proxy/S-4 filing details. Given WeWork's complex history with governance and SoftBank's significant stake, there may have been specific arrangements I'm not reliably recalling.

**Recommendation:** For accurate information on the post-merger voting structure, I would recommend reviewing the Form S-4 registration statement or the final merger proxy filed with the SEC.
