# Lock-Up Agreements in the WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

**Confidence: [HIGH] for general concepts, [MEDIUM] for WeWork-specific terms**
**Source: [TRAINING]**

## General Definition

Lock-up agreements are contractual provisions that restrict certain shareholders from selling their shares for a specified period following a transaction (such as an IPO, SPAC merger, or de-SPAC). They are designed to:

- Prevent a flood of shares hitting the market immediately post-transaction
- Provide price stability during the initial trading period
- Demonstrate insider confidence in the company's prospects

## Typical Structure in SPAC Mergers

| Party | Typical Lock-Up Period |
|-------|----------------------|
| Sponsor shares | 12 months (often with early release triggers) |
| Founder/management shares | 6-12 months |
| PIPE investors | Often 6 months or less |
| Existing shareholders | Varies, typically 6-12 months |

## WeWork/BowX Specific Terms

From my training knowledge, the WeWork SPAC deal included lock-up provisions for:

- **SoftBank** (largest shareholder) - subject to lock-up restrictions
- **BowX Sponsor shares** - standard sponsor lock-up terms
- **WeWork management/insiders** - restricted from immediate sales

**Note:** I have general knowledge that lock-ups were part of this deal, but I don't have reliable information about the *exact* durations or specific early release conditions for each party. The specific percentages and triggers would be detailed in the merger agreement and proxy filings.
