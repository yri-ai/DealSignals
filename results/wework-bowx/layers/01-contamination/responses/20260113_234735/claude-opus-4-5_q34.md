Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about registration rights in the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger context:

**Answer:** [MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

Registration rights in SPAC mergers like WeWork/BowX typically include:

1. **Demand Registration Rights** - Certain shareholders (typically founders, PIPE investors, and sponsor) have the right to demand the company file a registration statement to register their shares for public resale

2. **Piggyback Registration Rights** - Holders can include their shares in registration statements the company files for other purposes

3. **Shelf Registration Rights** - The company is typically required to file a shelf registration statement (S-1 or S-3) covering resale of shares held by certain investors

**What I recall specifically about WeWork/BowX:**
- A Registration Rights Agreement was part of the merger transaction documents
- The BowX Sponsor and certain WeWork legacy investors (including SoftBank) would have been parties to such agreement
- PIPE investors in the transaction also typically received registration rights

**Limitations of my knowledge:**
I don't have reliable information about:
- The specific timing requirements (e.g., how many days to file)
- Exact thresholds or minimums for demand rights
- Specific parties and their respective rights categories
- Lock-up exceptions tied to registration

For precise terms, you would need to review the actual Registration Rights Agreement filed as an exhibit to the proxy statement/prospectus or subsequent SEC filings.
