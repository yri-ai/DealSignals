# Market Context for WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger (2021)

**Confidence: [HIGH]** | **Source: [TRAINING]**

## SPAC Market Environment

The WeWork-BowX merger was announced in **March 2021**, during what was essentially the peak of the SPAC boom:

- **Record SPAC activity**: 2020-2021 saw unprecedented SPAC issuance, with over 600 SPACs raising ~$160 billion in 2021 alone
- **Frothy valuations**: Many SPACs were trading well above their $10 trust value
- **Celebrity/high-profile sponsors**: SPACs had become mainstream investment vehicles

## Broader Market Conditions

- **Post-COVID recovery rally**: Markets were buoyed by stimulus measures and vaccine rollouts
- **Low interest rate environment**: Fed funds rate near zero, encouraging risk-taking
- **Growth stock premium**: Investors favoring high-growth, even unprofitable companies
- **Commercial real estate uncertainty**: The pandemic had created significant questions about office space demand going forward

## WeWork-Specific Context

- WeWork was emerging from its disastrous 2019 failed IPO attempt
- Adam Neumann had departed; Sandeep Mathrani was CEO
- Company had undergone significant cost-cutting and restructuring
- Still unprofitable but narrative was "pandemic accelerated flexible workspace adoption"

## Timing Note

By the time the deal **closed in October 2021**, SPAC sentiment was already cooling, and many de-SPACed companies were trading below their merger valuations.
