Based on my training knowledge, I can address this question about the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger.

**Answer:** Yes, comparable transactions were disclosed in the merger materials.

**Details from training knowledge:**
- The proxy statement/prospectus for the BowX-WeWork merger included a fairness opinion and valuation analysis
- This type of analysis in SPAC mergers typically includes precedent transaction analysis (comparable M&A deals) and comparable company analysis
- For WeWork specifically, the financial advisors would have examined prior flexible workspace/co-working transactions and relevant tech-enabled real estate deals

**However, I must note:**
I have general knowledge that comparable transactions are a standard component of SPAC merger disclosures and fairness opinions, but I do not have specific recall of:
- Which exact comparable transactions were cited
- The specific multiples or metrics disclosed
- The precise framing or conclusions drawn from the comparables analysis

**Confidence:** [MEDIUM]

**Source:** [TRAINING] - This reflects general knowledge of SPAC merger disclosure requirements and typical S-4/proxy content, combined with awareness that this was a high-profile transaction that would have followed standard practices. I cannot confirm the specific details of what comparables were shown without access to the actual filing.
