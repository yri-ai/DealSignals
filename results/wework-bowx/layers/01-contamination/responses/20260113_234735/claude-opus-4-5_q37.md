Based on my training knowledge, I can provide the following information:

**Answer:** [LOW confidence] [UNCERTAIN]

I don't have reliable specific information about WeWork's detailed exit/refinancing strategy for lease obligations as presented in the BowX SPAC merger materials.

**What I do know from training (MEDIUM confidence):**

WeWork's lease obligations were a central concern in the merger context. General strategies discussed publicly included:

1. **Lease renegotiations** - WeWork undertook significant efforts to renegotiate or exit unfavorable leases, particularly after the failed 2019 IPO
2. **Portfolio rationalization** - Closing underperforming locations and consolidating footprint
3. **Landlord equity conversions** - In some cases, converting fixed lease obligations to revenue-sharing or management agreements
4. **Sublease optimization** - Improving sublease rates and occupancy

**What I cannot reliably confirm:**
- Specific refinancing mechanisms outlined in the SPAC investor presentation
- Quantified targets for lease liability reduction
- Timeline commitments for portfolio restructuring
- Specific financial projections tied to lease strategies

The lease liability structure was a known risk factor in the transaction, but I don't have precise details on the exit strategy as articulated to BowX investors specifically.

**Recommendation:** For accurate details on the stated strategy, I would need to reference the actual S-4 filing or investor presentation materials from the merger.
