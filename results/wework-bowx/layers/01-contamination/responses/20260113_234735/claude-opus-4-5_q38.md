## Post-Merger Integration & Business Model Changes

**Confidence: MEDIUM** | **Source: TRAINING**

Based on my training knowledge, here are the planned changes I'm aware of:

### Strategic Shifts Discussed

1. **Focus on Profitability Over Growth**
   - WeWork indicated a shift away from the aggressive expansion strategy that characterized the Adam Neumann era
   - Emphasis on reaching profitability rather than growth-at-all-costs

2. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Plans to exit underperforming locations
   - Renegotiate or terminate unfavorable leases
   - Focus on markets with stronger unit economics

3. **Technology & Enterprise Focus**
   - Continued investment in technology platform
   - Greater emphasis on enterprise clients (larger companies) rather than individual members/small startups
   - These clients typically provide more stable, higher-margin revenue

4. **Cost Structure Improvements**
   - Ongoing efforts to reduce corporate overhead
   - More disciplined approach to new location buildouts

### What I'm Less Certain About

- Specific numerical targets for profitability timeline
- Detailed integration mechanics with BowX
- Specific technology investments or product launches

**Caveat:** Much of the detailed integration planning would have been in investor presentations and SEC filings that I may not have complete information on. The actual execution of these plans and any subsequent changes would have occurred after my knowledge cutoff.

I don't have reliable information about highly specific operational milestones or detailed budget allocations for post-merger initiatives.
