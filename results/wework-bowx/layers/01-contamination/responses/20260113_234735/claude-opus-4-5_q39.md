Based on my training knowledge, I can provide some information about WeWork's debt structure following the SPAC merger, though with important caveats.

**[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]**

## What I Know About WeWork's Post-Merger Debt Structure:

**General Debt Context:**
- WeWork carried substantial debt obligations going into and following the BowX merger
- The company had senior secured notes and various credit facilities
- SoftBank had previously provided significant debt financing and credit support

**Likely Covenant Areas (based on typical distressed company debt structures):**

I do not have specific, detailed knowledge of the exact covenant terms from WeWork's post-merger credit agreements. However, for a company in WeWork's financial position, typical covenants would include:

- Liquidity maintenance requirements
- Restrictions on additional indebtedness
- Limitations on asset sales and dispositions
- Change of control provisions
- Restrictions on dividend payments and distributions
- Reporting requirements

**What I'm Uncertain About:**
- Specific financial ratio requirements (leverage ratios, coverage ratios)
- Exact dollar thresholds for covenant compliance
- Amendment history or covenant modifications post-merger
- Specific terms negotiated in connection with the SPAC transaction

**Honest Assessment:** I don't have reliable, specific information about the detailed debt covenants and restrictions. The specifics would be found in WeWork's 10-K filings, credit agreement exhibits, and merger proxy documents, which I cannot recall with precision. I recommend reviewing WeWork's SEC filings directly for accurate covenant language.
