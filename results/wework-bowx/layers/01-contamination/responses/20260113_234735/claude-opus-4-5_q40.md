**Investment Recommendation Assessment**

[MEDIUM confidence] [TRAINING]

This is inherently a judgment call, but based on my training knowledge, I can outline the key considerations that would have informed an investment decision at the time of the merger:

## Reasons for Caution (Significant)

1. **Track record of losses**: WeWork had never demonstrated a path to profitability
2. **Failed IPO history**: The 2019 S-1 revealed serious governance and financial concerns
3. **Business model questions**: Unit economics were unproven at scale
4. **SPAC premium concerns**: Valuations in SPAC deals often proved optimistic
5. **Leadership upheaval**: Complete management change post-Adam Neumann

## Potential Bull Case (Weaker)

1. **Lower valuation**: $9B vs. $47B represented "reset" expectations
2. **New management**: Sandeep Mathrani brought real estate credibility
3. **Flex space tailwinds**: Post-COVID hybrid work trends
4. **Restructuring efforts**: Cost-cutting already underway

## My Assessment

**I would NOT have recommended investing** based on the information available at the merger date.

The risk/reward profile was unfavorable:
- Unproven path to profitability
- History of cash burn
- SPAC structures historically underperformed
- Too many execution risks remained

**Important caveat**: I know from training that WeWork subsequently filed for bankruptcy in late 2023, which validates the cautious view. However, I'm answering based on what was knowable at merger time, not with hindsight.

**Confidence note**: This is analytical judgment, not a factual claim—investment recommendations inherently involve uncertainty.
