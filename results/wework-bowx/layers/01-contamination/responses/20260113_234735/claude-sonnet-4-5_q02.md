I don't have reliable information about the specific year-over-year revenue growth rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, I don't have reliable specific financial metrics like the exact revenue growth rate from my training data. Revenue growth rates are precise numerical figures that would have been disclosed in SEC filings (like the merger proxy statement or investor presentations), and I cannot confidently recall those specific numbers.

To get this information accurately, you would need to review:
- The SEC Form S-4 or proxy statement filed for the merger
- WeWork's investor presentation from that period
- The actual financial statements included in those disclosures

I want to avoid giving you an incorrect percentage that you might rely on for analysis.
