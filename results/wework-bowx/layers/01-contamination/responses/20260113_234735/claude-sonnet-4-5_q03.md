I don't have reliable information about the specific operating losses for WeWork during the most recent period before or around the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork went public through a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021, I don't have reliable specific figures for their operating losses from that time period stored in my training data. WeWork was known to have significant losses historically, but I cannot provide accurate numbers for the specific period you're asking about without risking making up information.

To get accurate operating loss figures, you would need to refer to:
- The SEC filings (S-4 or proxy statements) from the SPAC merger
- WeWork's quarterly or annual reports from 2021
- The investor presentation materials from that transaction
