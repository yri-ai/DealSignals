I don't have reliable information about the specific cash burn rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork had significant cash burn issues historically (particularly leading up to its failed 2019 IPO), I cannot provide specific figures for the cash burn rate at the time of the 2021 SPAC transaction without risking inaccuracy.

Cash burn rate would have been a critical metric disclosed in the merger proxy statement/investor presentation, but I don't have reliable access to those specific figures from my training data.

If you need this information, I'd recommend reviewing:
- The Form S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC
- The investor presentation from March 2021 when the deal was announced
- WeWork's financial statements from that period
