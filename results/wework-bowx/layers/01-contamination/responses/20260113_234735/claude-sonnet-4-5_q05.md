I don't have reliable information about the specific cash runway at current burn rate for WeWork at the time of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- The company had significant cash burn issues historically
- Cash runway would depend on the specific cash position post-merger and the quarterly burn rate at that time

I do not have reliable specific figures from my training data about:
- The exact cash balance after the SPAC transaction closed
- The specific quarterly or monthly burn rate in 2021
- The calculated runway based on those figures

This type of granular financial metric would have been disclosed in SEC filings (like 8-Ks, 10-Qs, or investor presentations) at the time, but I cannot confidently recall the specific numbers from my training data.
