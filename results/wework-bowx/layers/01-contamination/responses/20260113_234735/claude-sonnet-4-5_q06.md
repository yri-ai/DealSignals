I don't have reliable information about the specific path to profitability and timeline that WeWork stated in connection with the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I cannot reliably recall the specific profitability projections, target dates, or the detailed path to profitability that were presented in their merger materials or investor presentations.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review:
- The investor presentation/deck from the SPAC announcement
- The SEC filings (S-4 registration statement)
- Earnings calls or investor materials from that time period

I prefer not to speculate on specific financial projections or timelines when I'm not certain of the details.
