I don't have reliable information about the specific key assumptions underlying the projections in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC mergers typically involve financial projections with various assumptions about revenue growth, occupancy rates, expansion plans, cost structures, etc.

I cannot reliably specify what the *actual* key assumptions were in WeWork's specific projections without access to their investor presentation or SEC filings from that transaction. 

For a company like WeWork, typical assumptions might include:
- Membership growth rates
- Occupancy rates
- Revenue per member
- Real estate expansion plans
- Operating leverage assumptions

But I cannot confirm these were the specific assumptions used in their 2021 SPAC projections with HIGH confidence.

**What I'd need:** The actual investor presentation deck or SEC S-4 filing from the WeWork-BowX transaction to give you accurate details about their projection assumptions.
