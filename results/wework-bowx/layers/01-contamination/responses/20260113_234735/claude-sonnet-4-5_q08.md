I don't have reliable information about the specific contribution margin per membership figure for WeWork in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- Contribution margin per membership would be a relevant metric for a membership-based workspace business
- Such metrics would typically appear in investor presentations or SEC filings related to the SPAC transaction

I cannot recall the specific numerical value for this metric from my training data. Financial metrics like this are precise figures that shouldn't be approximated, and I don't want to risk providing incorrect information that could mislead financial analysis.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The original SPAC merger investor presentation
- SEC Form S-4 or 8-K filings from the transaction
- WeWork's investor relations materials from that period
