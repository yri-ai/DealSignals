I don't have reliable information about the specific "revenue per available desk/workstation" metric for the WeWork/BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- Revenue per available desk/workstation would be a logical operational metric for a coworking space company to track
- This type of metric would measure revenue generation efficiency of their physical capacity

I do not have reliable specific figures or detailed information about this particular metric from the WeWork-BowX transaction documentation in my training data. 

To get accurate information about this metric, you would need to reference:
- The actual SPAC merger investor presentations
- SEC filings (S-4 registration statement)
- WeWork's operational disclosures from that period

I should not speculate on specific values or definitions without having clear information from my training data.
