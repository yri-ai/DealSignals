I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific occupancy rates or trends during the 2021 BowX SPAC merger period from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

**What I can tell you generally:**

**Occupancy rate** in the context of flexible workspace companies like WeWork typically refers to the percentage of available desks/offices that are leased or occupied by members. It's calculated as:
- Occupied space / Total available space × 100%

This is a key operational metric for coworking companies.

**What I don't have specific knowledge about:**
- WeWork's actual occupancy rates at the time of the BowX merger
- How those rates trended leading up to or during the SPAC transaction
- Specific figures that may have been disclosed in merger documents

If you need accurate occupancy rate data for the WeWork-BowX merger, I would recommend checking:
- The actual SEC filings (S-4, investor presentations)
- Official press releases from that period
- Contemporary financial news coverage

I want to be clear that I cannot provide specific numbers or trends without potentially confabulating information that may be inaccurate.
