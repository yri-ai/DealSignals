Companies often track churn rates monthly, quarterly, or annually to assess business health and customer loyalty.\n\n**Note:** This is general business knowledge about the metric itself. I cannot confirm with high confidence whether specific churn rate figures were disclosed in the WeWork/BowX merger documents without seeing those specific documents, though churn rate would be a relevant metric for WeWork's business model given its membership-based co-working space operations.",
