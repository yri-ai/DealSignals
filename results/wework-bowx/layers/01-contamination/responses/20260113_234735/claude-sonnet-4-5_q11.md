Member churn rate is a business metric that measures the percentage of customers (or members) who discontinue their subscription or service during a given time period. 

It's calculated as:
**Churn Rate = (Number of customers lost during period / Total customers at start of period) × 100**

For example, if a company starts a month with 1,000 members and loses 50 members during that month, the monthly churn rate would be 5%.

This metric is particularly important for:
- Subscription-based businesses
- Co-working spaces (like WeWork)
- SaaS companies
- Membership organizations

A lower churn rate is generally better, as it indicates higher customer retention and satisfaction. Companies often track churn rates monthly, quarterly, or annually to assess business health and customer loyalty.

**Note:** This is general business knowledge about the metric itself. I cannot confirm with high confidence whether specific churn rate figures were disclosed in the WeWork/BowX merger documents without seeing those specific documents, though churn rate would be a relevant metric for WeWork's business model given its membership-based co-working space operations.
