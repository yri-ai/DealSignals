I don't have reliable information about the specific average revenue per member figure for WeWork from the BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork completed a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, and that revenue per member would be a standard metric for a workspace company to disclose in merger documents, I cannot recall the specific figure from my training data. 

To accurately answer this question, you would need to reference the actual investor presentation or SEC filings (likely the S-4 registration statement) from that transaction, which would have contained detailed financial metrics including membership counts and revenue figures that could be used to calculate this metric.
