I don't have reliable information about the specific total lease obligations figure for WeWork in the context of the BowX SPAC merger in 2021.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I understand that "total lease obligations" generally refers to the aggregate amount a company is committed to pay under its lease agreements (which would have been particularly significant for WeWork given its business model of leasing office space), I cannot provide a specific dollar amount or detailed breakdown for WeWork's lease obligations at the time of the BowX merger without risking making up information.

If you need this specific financial data point, I would recommend consulting:
- The actual SPAC merger documents (S-4 filing)
- WeWork's investor presentations from that period
- Financial disclosures from 2021

This is a case where having the specific number matters, and I should not guess at financial figures.
