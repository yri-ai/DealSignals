I don't have reliable information about the specific duration profile of WeWork's lease commitments in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork's business model historically involved long-term lease commitments (often 10-15 years) that they would then sublease on shorter terms to customers, I cannot provide specific details about:
- The exact lease duration profile at the time of the BowX merger in 2021
- The weighted average lease term
- The maturity schedule of their lease portfolio
- How these commitments were specifically disclosed in the merger documentation

This type of detailed financial information would typically be found in the SEC filings (S-4, investor presentations) associated with the SPAC transaction, but I cannot recall the specific figures from my training data.
