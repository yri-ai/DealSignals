I don't have reliable information about the specific lease termination provisions in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I have general knowledge that:
- WeWork's business model involves leasing properties long-term and subleasing short-term
- Lease obligations were a critical financial concern for WeWork
- SPAC merger documents typically include detailed disclosures about material contracts and liabilities

I do not have specific, reliable information from my training data about the particular lease termination provisions that were disclosed or negotiated as part of the 2021 BowX-WeWork merger.

To answer this accurately, you would need to review:
- The actual merger proxy statement/S-4 filing
- WeWork's lease agreements and their termination clauses
- Risk factor disclosures related to lease obligations

I cannot provide specific details without risking inaccuracy.
