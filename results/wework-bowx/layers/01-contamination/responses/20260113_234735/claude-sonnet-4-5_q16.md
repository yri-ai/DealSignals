I don't have reliable information about this specific detail regarding what happens to WeWork's business at 70% occupancy in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public
- Occupancy rates are critical metrics for WeWork's flexible workspace business model
- There were various financial projections and thresholds discussed in SPAC merger materials

I cannot reliably recall the specific significance of the 70% occupancy threshold or what particular business outcome or financial milestone was associated with that specific number in their merger documentation or projections.

This seems like it would be a specific detail from the merger prospectus or investor presentations that I should not guess about.
