I don't have reliable information about this specific detail regarding WeWork's business model at 50% occupancy in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I have general knowledge that:
- WeWork's business model involved leasing office space long-term and subleasing it short-term to members
- Occupancy rates were critical to profitability
- The company went through a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021

I do not have specific information from my training data about what particular threshold or outcome occurs at exactly 50% occupancy, whether that relates to:
- Break-even points
- Profitability metrics
- Covenant triggers
- Or other business milestones

This seems like it would be specific information from investor presentations, SEC filings, or financial models that I cannot reliably recall. To answer this accurately, you would need to reference the actual SPAC merger documents or investor materials.
