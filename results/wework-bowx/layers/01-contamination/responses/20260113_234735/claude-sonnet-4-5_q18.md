I don't have reliable information about the specific implied enterprise value from the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, I cannot reliably recall the specific enterprise valuation figure from that transaction. Enterprise valuations in SPAC deals are typically disclosed in the merger announcements and investor presentations, but I don't want to risk providing an incorrect number.

If you need this specific figure, I'd recommend checking:
- The original merger announcement press releases from 2021
- The SEC filings (particularly the S-4 registration statement)
- WeWork's investor relations materials from that period

These would contain the official enterprise value that was agreed upon in the transaction.
