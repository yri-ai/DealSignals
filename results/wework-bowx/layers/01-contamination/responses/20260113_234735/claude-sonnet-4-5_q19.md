I don't have reliable information about the specific valuation methodology used to justify the price in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- The deal valued WeWork at approximately $9 billion enterprise value
- SPAC mergers typically use methodologies like DCF (discounted cash flow), comparable company analysis, and precedent transactions

I cannot reliably state which specific valuation methodology or combination of methodologies was primarily used to justify the pricing in this particular transaction without access to the actual investor presentation or SEC filings from that deal.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review:
- The investor presentation from the merger announcement
- SEC Form S-4 or other relevant filings
- The proxy statement provided to shareholders

I prefer to acknowledge this limitation rather than speculate about the specific valuation approach used.
