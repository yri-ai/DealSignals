I don't have reliable information about the specific comparable transactions or companies that were cited in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC merger presentations typically include comparable company analyses (often called "comps")
- For a flexible workspace company like WeWork, comparables might logically include other real estate, co-working, or office-related companies

I cannot reliably recall the specific companies or transactions that were actually cited in the WeWork-BowX merger materials. Any list I provided would be speculation rather than confirmed knowledge from my training data.

To get accurate information about the specific comparables used, you would need to review the actual investor presentation, proxy statement, or S-4 filing from that transaction.
