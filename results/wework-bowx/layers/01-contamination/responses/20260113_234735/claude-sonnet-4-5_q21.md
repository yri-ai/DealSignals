# Key Executives - WeWork/BowX SPAC Merger

## [MEDIUM] Confidence - [TRAINING]

Based on my training knowledge about the 2021 WeWork/BowX merger:

### WeWork Leadership:

**Sandeep Mathrani - CEO**
- [HIGH confidence] He was appointed WeWork CEO in February 2020, replacing co-founder Adam Neumann
- Background: Former senior executive at Brookfield Properties and CEO of GGP Inc. (major mall operator)
- Brought real estate operational expertise and was tasked with restructuring WeWork post-2019 crisis

**Andre Fernandez - CFO** 
- [MEDIUM confidence] Joined as CFO to help stabilize finances
- Background in real estate and finance

### BowX Acquisition Corp:

**Vivek Ranadivé - Chairman/Sponsor**
- [HIGH confidence] Tech entrepreneur and owner of Sacramento Kings NBA team
- Founded TIBCO Software

**Adam Neumann - Former CEO** (departed)
- [HIGH confidence] Co-founder who left in 2019 after failed IPO attempt
- His leadership and governance issues were a major factor in WeWork's 2019 valuation collapse

## Important Context:

The key narrative was that Mathrani represented a "adult supervision" turnaround story - bringing operational discipline after Neumann's chaotic tenure. The executive team's track record was specifically about stabilizing and restructuring WeWork rather than hypergrowth.

**Note:** Some specific details about other executives may be incomplete in my training data.
