# SoftBank's Role and Ongoing Obligations in WeWork-BowX SPAC Merger

**[MEDIUM] Confidence - [TRAINING]**

Based on my training knowledge about the WeWork-BowX merger in 2021:

## SoftBank's Role:

1. **Major Stakeholder**: SoftBank was WeWork's largest shareholder and had been since making massive investments starting in 2017. They became the controlling shareholder after WeWork's failed 2019 IPO attempt.

2. **Financial Commitment**: SoftBank committed to providing substantial financial support as part of the SPAC transaction, though I cannot specify exact dollar amounts with confidence.

3. **Continued Investment**: As part of the merger agreement, SoftBank agreed to remain a significant investor in the combined company post-merger.

## Ongoing Obligations:

I have general knowledge that SoftBank had commitments related to:
- Providing additional capital/financing support
- Maintaining a significant ownership stake
- Potentially having board representation

**However, I don't have reliable specific details about:**
- Exact dollar amounts of their commitments
- Specific lock-up periods or restrictions on selling shares
- Detailed terms of any ongoing financial obligations
- Precise governance rights or board seats

**Note**: SoftBank's involvement was crucial to the deal's credibility given WeWork's previous challenges, but for specific contractual obligations and financial commitments, you would need to reference the actual merger documents (S-4 filing, investor presentations, etc.).
