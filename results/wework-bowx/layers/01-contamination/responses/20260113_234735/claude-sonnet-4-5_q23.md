I don't have reliable information about specific related-party transactions in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021
- Related-party transactions are common in SPAC deals and typically disclosed in SEC filings
- WeWork had various relationships with entities connected to its founder Adam Neumann

I cannot reliably recall the specific related-party transactions that were disclosed in connection with this particular SPAC merger. Related-party transaction details would have been in the proxy statement/S-4 filing, but I don't have confident knowledge of those specific details from my training.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review the actual SEC filings (particularly the definitive proxy statement) from that transaction.
