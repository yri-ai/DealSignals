I don't have reliable information about the specific management incentives and compensation structures in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public
- SPAC deals typically involve various incentive structures for management, sponsors, and existing shareholders
- Such deals often include equity rollovers, earnouts, and performance-based compensation

I do not have specific, reliable details from my training data about:
- The exact compensation packages for WeWork management
- Specific equity retention percentages
- Earnout terms or performance milestones
- BowX sponsor promote details
- Any special incentive arrangements for key executives

To get accurate information about management compensation in this deal, you would need to review the actual SEC filings (likely the S-4 registration statement and proxy materials) from 2021.
