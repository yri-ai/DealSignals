# Adam Neumann's Ongoing Relationship/Exposure (WeWork/BowX SPAC 2021)

**[MEDIUM] Confidence - [TRAINING]**

## What I Know:

From my training data, I understand that:

1. **Adam Neumann was ousted as CEO in 2019** - This occurred after the failed IPO attempt and concerns about corporate governance and valuation.

2. **By the time of the BowX SPAC merger (2021)**, Adam Neumann was no longer involved in WeWork's operations or management.

3. **Financial settlement** - Neumann received a significant exit package when he left, which included:
   - Cash payment
   - Stock that would be subject to various conditions
   - Consulting fees (for a period)

4. **Equity position** - My understanding is that Neumann retained some equity stake in WeWork following his departure, though substantially reduced from his previous holdings.

## Key Uncertainty:

I'm less certain about the **specific details** of his ongoing exposure at the time of the 2021 SPAC merger, including:
- The exact percentage of equity he retained
- Whether he had any voting rights or board observer status
- Specific lock-up provisions or selling restrictions on his shares

**Note:** This represents general knowledge about the situation. For precise details about his contractual arrangements, equity percentage, or restrictions at the SPAC merger date, I would need to refer to the actual merger documents or SEC filings from that period.
