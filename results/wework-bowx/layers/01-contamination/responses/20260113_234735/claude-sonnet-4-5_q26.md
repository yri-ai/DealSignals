I don't have reliable information about the specific disclosed risk factors from the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021 to go public, I cannot reliably recall the specific risk factors that were disclosed in their SEC filings (such as the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials). 

Risk factors in SPAC mergers typically include items like:
- Business model viability concerns
- Competition risks
- Regulatory issues
- Financial performance uncertainties
- Integration challenges

However, I cannot confirm which specific risk factors were actually prioritized or disclosed as "top" risks in WeWork's case without access to the actual documents. To get accurate information about their disclosed risk factors, you would need to review the SEC filings directly (particularly the Form S-4 and any proxy statements filed in connection with the merger).
