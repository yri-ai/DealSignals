I don't have reliable information about specific material litigation or disputes related to the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger from my training data.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
1. WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public
2. WeWork had a troubled history including the failed 2019 IPO attempt
3. There were various legal and regulatory issues in WeWork's past

I cannot reliably tell you from my training data what specific material litigation or disputes were disclosed in the merger documentation or were ongoing at the time of the 2021 SPAC transaction. This would typically be detailed in SEC filings like the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials, but I don't have confident recall of those specific details.

To get accurate information about material litigation, you would need to review the actual SEC filings from that merger.
