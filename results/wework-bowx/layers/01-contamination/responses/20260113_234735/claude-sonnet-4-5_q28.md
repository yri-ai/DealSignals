I don't have reliable information about specific going concern disclosures in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
1. WeWork had significant financial challenges leading up to and during this period (2019-2021)
2. Going concern disclosures are standard audit requirements when there's substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue operations
3. The WeWork-BowX merger did occur in 2021

I cannot reliably confirm from my training data whether specific going concern disclosures were included in the merger documents, SEC filings, or financial statements associated with this transaction. Given WeWork's well-publicized financial difficulties during this timeframe, such disclosures would not be surprising, but I should not speculate about their presence or absence without certain knowledge.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review the actual SEC filings (such as the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials) from the merger.
