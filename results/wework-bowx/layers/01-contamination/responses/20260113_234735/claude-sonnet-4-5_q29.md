I don't have reliable information about specific auditor statements regarding the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, I don't have specific details from my training about what auditors said in their reports or opinions related to this transaction. Auditor statements would typically be found in SEC filings like the S-4 registration statement or proxy materials, but I cannot reliably recall specific auditor commentary from those documents.

To get accurate information about auditor statements, you would need to review:
- The official SEC filings (S-4, 8-K, 10-K forms)
- Auditor opinion letters
- Any going concern warnings or qualifications issued

I don't want to speculate about what auditors may have said, as this would be important factual information that should be verified from primary sources.
