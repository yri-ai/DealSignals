I don't have reliable information about specific material weaknesses in internal controls for the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
1. WeWork had significant accounting and governance issues historically (including during the failed 2019 IPO attempt)
2. SPAC mergers generally require disclosure of internal control assessments
3. Companies emerging from restructuring or with past financial reporting issues often disclose material weaknesses

I cannot reliably confirm whether material weaknesses were specifically disclosed in the WeWork-BowX merger documentation in 2021 without access to the actual SEC filings (S-4, 8-K, or subsequent 10-K/10-Q reports).

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review:
- The definitive proxy statement/S-4 filing
- The 10-K filed after the merger completion
- Any 8-K filings discussing internal control matters

I should not speculate on something this specific and material to investor decisions.
