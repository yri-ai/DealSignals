I don't have reliable information about the specific board composition following the WeWork-BowX merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. in 2021, I don't have reliable details from my training data about:
- The exact number of board seats
- The specific individuals appointed to the board
- The allocation between WeWork legacy directors, BowX directors, and independent directors
- The board committee structure

This type of specific corporate governance detail would typically be disclosed in SEC filings (like the merger proxy statement or Form 8-K), but I cannot reliably recall those specifics from my training data.

If you need this information, I'd recommend checking:
- The definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed prior to the merger
- Form 8-K filings around the merger closing date
- WeWork's subsequent 10-K or 10-Q filings which would list current board members
