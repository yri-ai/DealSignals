I don't have reliable information about the specific voting structure post-merger for the WeWork-BowX transaction.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public, I don't have reliable details from my training data about the specific voting rights structure that was established post-merger (such as dual-class share structures, voting rights per share class, or special voting arrangements).

This type of specific governance detail would typically be found in the merger proxy statement or the company's charter documents, but I cannot confidently recall these specifics from my training data.
