I don't have reliable information about the specific lock-up agreements from the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that lock-up agreements are standard provisions in SPAC mergers that prevent certain shareholders (typically sponsors, PIPE investors, and existing company shareholders) from selling their shares for a specified period after the transaction closes, I cannot reliably recall the specific terms, duration, or parties involved in the WeWork-BowX lock-up agreements.

To get accurate information about:
- The lock-up period durations
- Which parties were subject to lock-ups
- Any early release provisions or conditions
- Exceptions to the lock-up restrictions

You would need to refer to the actual SEC filings (S-4 registration statement or 8-K forms) from that transaction.
