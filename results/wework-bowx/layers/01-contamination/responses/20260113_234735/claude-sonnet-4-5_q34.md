I don't have reliable information about the specific registration rights in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that SPAC mergers typically include registration rights agreements that allow certain shareholders (like PIPE investors, sponsors, and existing shareholders) to register their shares for resale, I cannot reliably tell you the specific registration rights provisions that existed in this particular transaction without access to the actual merger documents (such as the registration rights agreement or S-4 filing).

Registration rights agreements in SPAC deals generally cover things like:
- Demand registration rights
- Piggyback registration rights
- S-3 registration rights
- Lock-up periods and their exceptions

But the specific terms, timelines, and parties covered in the WeWork-BowX case would require reviewing the actual transaction documents, which I cannot reliably recall from my training data.
