I don't have reliable information about whether comparable transactions were specifically disclosed in the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger documentation.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that:
- WeWork did complete a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021
- SPAC merger presentations and proxy statements typically include valuation methodologies
- Comparable company analysis and comparable transactions are standard valuation approaches in such deals

I cannot reliably confirm from my training data whether comparable transactions were actually disclosed in this specific case, or provide details about what those comparable transactions might have been if they were included.

To get accurate information about this, you would need to review the actual merger documents (proxy statement/registration statement) filed with the SEC for this transaction.
