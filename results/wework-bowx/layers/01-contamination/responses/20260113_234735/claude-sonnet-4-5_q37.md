I don't have reliable information about the specific exit/refinancing strategy for WeWork's lease obligations in the context of the BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know from my training that:
- WeWork had significant long-term lease obligations that were a major financial concern
- The company's business model involved leasing properties long-term and subleasing short-term, creating structural challenges
- Lease liabilities were a critical issue discussed during the SPAC merger process

I do not have specific, reliable information from my training about:
- The concrete exit strategy for these leases that was presented in the merger documentation
- Specific refinancing mechanisms or plans
- Whether there were lease renegotiation plans, buyout strategies, or other specific approaches

This would have been detailed in the merger proxy statement or investor presentations, but I cannot recall those specific details with confidence.
