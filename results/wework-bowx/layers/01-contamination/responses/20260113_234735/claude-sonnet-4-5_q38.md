I don't have reliable information about specific post-merger integration plans or business model changes that were planned for the WeWork-BowX SPAC merger.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

What I know from training:
- WeWork did go public via a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, after the failed 2019 IPO attempt
- This occurred after significant restructuring under new leadership (Sandeep Mathrani as CEO)
- WeWork had already undergone major changes before the SPAC merger, including leadership changes, cost-cutting, and pulling back from non-core businesses

However, I don't have reliable specific details about:
- Particular integration plans announced for the post-SPAC merger period
- Specific business model pivots planned as part of the BowX transaction
- Strategic initiatives tied specifically to the SPAC closing

Any specific details about post-merger plans would require access to the merger documents, investor presentations, or SEC filings from that transaction, which I cannot reliably recall from my training data.
