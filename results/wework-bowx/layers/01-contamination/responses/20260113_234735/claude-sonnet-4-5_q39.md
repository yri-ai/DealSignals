I don't have reliable information about the specific debt covenants and restrictions that existed in the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

While I know that WeWork completed a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, the specific details of debt covenants and restrictions would have been contained in detailed transaction documents (like the proxy statement/S-4 filing) that I cannot reliably recall from my training data.

Debt covenants typically include things like:
- Financial ratio requirements (leverage, interest coverage, etc.)
- Restrictions on additional borrowing
- Asset sale limitations
- Dividend restrictions

However, I cannot confirm which specific covenants applied to WeWork's debt structure in this transaction without access to the actual documents. This type of granular financial detail would require reviewing the specific SEC filings associated with the merger.
