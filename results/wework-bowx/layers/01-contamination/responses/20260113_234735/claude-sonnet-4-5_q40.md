I don't have reliable information about this specific investment decision.

**[LOW] confidence - [UNCERTAIN]**

Here's what I can say:

**What I know from training:**
- WeWork did merge with BowX Acquisition Corp (a SPAC) in 2021, going public after the failed 2019 IPO attempt
- The merger valued WeWork at approximately $9 billion, significantly less than its previous $47 billion private valuation
- WeWork had a history of significant losses and corporate governance issues
- The flexible workspace/coworking model faced challenges, especially during COVID-19

**Why I cannot make an investment recommendation:**
1. Investment decisions require detailed analysis of financials, market conditions, personal risk tolerance, and investment timeframe - factors that vary by individual
2. I don't have access to the specific merger terms, updated financial projections, or post-merger performance data that would be critical
3. Any investment recommendation would be speculation rather than analysis
4. The appropriateness of any investment depends entirely on individual circumstances

**Note:** I can discuss the general facts of the case from my training knowledge, but making actual investment recommendations would be inappropriate and unreliable. If you're interested in my assessment of the company's situation at that time based on publicly known factors, I can discuss that instead.
