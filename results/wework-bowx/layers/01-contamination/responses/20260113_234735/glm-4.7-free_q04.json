          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Role:** Financial analyst assistant.\n    *   **Constraint:** Answer *only* based on pre-existing training knowledge (no browsing, no speculation).\n    *   **Topic:** WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.\n    *   **Specific Question:** What is the cash burn rate?\n    *   **Required Output:** Answer, Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), Source indication (TRAINING or UNCERTAIN), and a refusal phrase if information is unreliable.\n\n2.  **Retrieve Knowledge (Internal Knowledge Access):**\n    *   *Query:* WeWork BowX SPAC merger cash burn rate 2021.\n    *   *Facts Recall:*\n        *   WeWork went public via SPAC with BowX Acquisition Corp.\n        *   The investor presentation ( decks) and SEC filings (Form S-4, F-4) were released around March 2021.\n        *   Key metrics discussed: Adjusted EBITDA, revenue, liquidity, and cash burn.\n        *   Specific burn rate figures: I recall figures like \"negative free cash flow\" or \"net cash used in operating activities\" being cited.\n        *   *Specific Numbers:* In the SPAC presentation (March 2021), WeWork projected cash burn or free cash flow. A commonly cited figure from that time (and the investor presentation) was that WeWork was burning cash, but they projected reaching positive EBITDA and free cash flow by 2022.\n        *   *Looking for the specific \"cash burn rate\" number mentioned in that context:* In the presentation, they showed \"Free Cash Flow\" metrics.\n        *   *Historical Data (2019/2020):* Before the SPAC, WeWork was burning massive amounts (over $2B/year). By the time of the SPAC (2021), they claimed to have reduced it significantly.\n        *   *Projection:* They projected negative free cash flow to decrease.\n        *   *Specific \"Burn Rate\" Number:* The presentation often cited \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" or \"Net Cash Used in Operating Activities\". In the 4Q 2020 earnings and the SPAC deck, they showed improvement.\n        *   *Search in memory for a specific \"per month\" or \"annualized\" figure cited as the *current* burn rate at the time of the SPAC announcement:*\n            *   In 2020, WeWork reported an annual cash burn of around $2.2 billion. By early 2021, they claimed to have cut this.\n            *   The SPAC deck (March 2021) showed 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of negative $1.9 billion (approx) but improving.\n            *   There was a specific figure often cited in news coverage of the SPAC deal regarding the *then-current* or *projected* burn.\n            *   *News reports:* Bloomberg, FT, etc. discussed the burn. A figure like \"burning roughly $500 million a quarter\" or similar comes to mind.\n            *   *Checking against specific S-4 data:* The Form S-4 usually contains the detailed financials.\n            *   *Specific figure:* I recall the presentation highlighting a reduction in cash burn. In 2020, they burned cash. They projected 2021 Adjusted EBITDA to be roughly negative $1.3 to $1.5 billion range (approx).\n            *   *Is there a precise \"Cash Burn Rate\" figure widely cited as a static number?* Usually, analysts calculate this. WeWork presented \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\".\n            *   Let's look for the specific *projection* in the SPAC deck (the \"Management Case\"). They projected Adjusted Free Cash Flow for 2021 to be negative ~$1.7B and 2022 to be positive.\n            *   *Actuals:* In Q4 2020, cash burn was lower.\n            *   *Crucial check:* Did the prompt ask for the *projected* burn or the *historical* burn? It just says \"What is the cash burn rate?\" (implying the time of the merger/SPAC).\n\n    *   *Refining the specific number:*\n        *   WeWork's SPAC presentation (March 2021) showed 2020 \"Net Cash Used in Operating Activities\" was roughly $2.1 billion.\n        *   They projected 2021 \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" to be negative $1.7 billion.\n        *   However, \"cash burn rate\" is often a quarterly or monthly metric.\n        *   Let's look for a specific reported figure from the SPAC filing.\n        *   In the *investor presentation*, they highlighted a reduction in \"average monthly cash burn\" from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020.\n        *   In Q4 2020, they reported roughly $120 million - $140 million in average monthly cash burn?\n        *   *Self-Correction/Verification:* I need to be careful not to hallucinate the exact monthly number if I'm not 100% sure.\n        *   I recall reading about the \"burn rate\" being a major point of contention or analysis. Many analysts noted that despite claims of profitability, the burn was still high.\n        *   The S-4 filing stated that cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $2.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2020.\n        *   Let's try to recall the *projected* cash needs. The SPAC provided $1.3 billion in gross proceeds.\n        *   Maybe the most reliable figure to cite is the \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" or \"Net Cash Used in Operating Activities\" for 2020 provided in the S-4/presentation.\n        *   2020 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities: ~$2.2 billion.\n        *   Projected 2021 Negative Free Cash Flow: ~$1.7 billion.\n        *   Monthly average in Q4 2020: This is a specific data point. I am *not* entirely confident in the exact *monthly* number (e.g., \"$120M/month\" vs \"$100M/month\").\n        *   However, the *annual* figures in the SPAC deck are distinct.\n        *   The prompt asks \"What is the cash burn rate?\". This is a singular value.\n        *   If I cannot pinpoint a single, universally agreed-upon \"rate\" (since burn varies monthly), I should describe the *figures provided in the SPAC documents*.\n\n    *   *Alternative interpretation:* Is the user asking about the *current* burn rate (as of now, 2024) or the rate *at the time of the 2021 SPAC*? The context is \"WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021\", so it implies historical data from that specific event.\n\n    *   *Re-evaluating the specific monthly number:*\n        *   According to the March 2021 investor presentation, WeWork claimed to have reduced its monthly cash burn significantly.\n        *   I recall a figure of **\"approximately $120 million per month\"** or similar being discussed in the context of the *run rate* at the end of 2020.\n        *   Let's check if I can verify \"approx $120 million\".\n        *   Another source suggests \"less than $150 million a month\".\n        *   Another suggests \"average monthly cash burn\" in Q4 2020 was **$129 million** (Net Cash Used in Operating Activities / 3). (2.2B annual / 12 = ~183M average, but Q4 was much lower).\n        *   Actually, looking at the cash flow statements from that time:\n            *   Net cash used in operating activities for the 3 months ended Dec 31, 2020 was **$467 million** (roughly $155M/month).\n            *   For the 3 months ended Sep 30, 2020, it was higher.\n        *   Wait, looking at the *adjusted* free cash flow is usually how companies spin \"burn\".\n        *   In the presentation, they highlighted \"Average monthly cash burn\" excluding capex or non-recurring items.\n        *   The BowX merger presentation had a slide titled \"Liquidity and Capital Allocation\".\n        *   It stated: \"Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $2.2B as of Dec 31, 2020\".\n        *   It projected \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" for 2021 to be negative **$1.7 billion**.\n        *   Projected for 2022 to be positive **$423 million**.\n        *   This implies a projected burn of roughly **$140 million per month** in 2021 ($1.7B / 12).\n\n    *   *Decision:* The most robust answer based on training data is to cite the **projected** cash burn figures from the SPAC documents, specifically the **$1.7 billion** projected negative free cash flow for 2021 (or the 2020 actuals of ~$2.2B), rather than guessing a specific monthly \"run rate\" which fluctuates and was calculated differently by different parties (GAAP vs. non-GAAP).\n    *   However, the question asks \"What is the cash burn rate?\".\n    *   If I just say \"$1.7 billion a year\", that's a good answer derived from the SPAC deck.\n    *   If I recall a specific \"monthly burn rate\" claim from the CEO at the time (Sandeep Mathrani), he mentioned they reduced burn to roughly $100-$120 million a month in normalized quarters.\n    *   *Constraint Check:* \"Do NOT make up information.\" \"If you don't have reliable information, say so.\"\n    *   I am confident in the annualized figures from the S-4/Presentation (Negative FCF of $1.7B for 2021).\n    *   I am *medium* confident in the specific \"monthly\" claim often cited in news (e.g., $120M), but the specific GAAP cash flow statement shows higher numbers (Q4 2020 was ~$155M/month operating cash burn).\n    *   Therefore, the safest and most accurate answer based *strictly* on training knowledge of the SPAC filings is the projected **$1.7 billion** in negative free cash flow for 2021 (approx $140M/month). Or citing the 2020 actuals.\n    *   Let's go with the projection because the SPAC presentation was the primary document for the merger justification.\n\n    *   *Drafting the response:*\n        *   *Answer:* According to the SPAC investor presentation and S-4 registration statement filed in 2021, WeWork projected **Adjusted Free Cash Flow** to be approximately **negative $1.7 billion** for the year 2021. This implies a burn rate of roughly **$140 million per month**. (In 2020, actual cash used in operating activities was approximately $2.2 billion).\n        *   *Confidence:* MEDIUM. The specific \"monthly burn rate\" varies depending on whether you look at GAAP operating cash flow, free cash flow, or adjusted metrics used by management. The $1.7B annual projection is a concrete number from the deck, but calling it a definitive \"rate\" is tricky because \"burn rate\" is a loosely defined term in finance without a strict standard formula (excluding/including CapEx).\n        *   *Source:* TRAINING (General knowledge of the WeWork SPAC event).\n\n3.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   State the projected figures clearly.\n    *   Mention the variance between GAAP and adjusted figures to be precise.\n    *   Set confidence to MEDIUM because \"cash burn rate\" is not a standardized GAAP line item, and the number depends heavily on the definition (Operating Cash Flow vs Free Cash Flow).\n\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The user asked for \"THE cash burn rate\". If there isn't one single number, I must explain that.\n    *   *Specific Detail:* In the March 2021 presentation, WeWork stated that in Q4 2020, their cash burn (as defined by them, likely adjusted) was significantly reduced.\n    *   Let's stick to the $1.7B annual projected figure. It's the most prominent number associated with their \"burn\" narrative during the SPAC pitch.\n\n    *   *Confidence Check:* Is it HIGH? No, because \"cash burn rate\" could refer to the 2019 burn ($2.2B+), the 2020 actual ($2.2B GAAP), the 2020 monthly average ($183M), or the 2021 projection ($140M). Without the specific context of *which* burn rate the user wants (current then, future projection, past history), providing just one might be misleading, but providing the projection is the most relevant for the *merger* context. I will label it MEDIUM.\n\n    *   *Note:* The prompt asks for [TRAINING] or [UNCERTAIN]. My knowledge is from training.\n\n4.  **Constructing Final Output:**\n    *   Answer: Cite the 2021 projection of negative $1.7B in adjusted free cash flow. Mention the 2020 actuals for context.\n    *   Confidence: MEDIUM.\n    *   Source: TRAINING.",
