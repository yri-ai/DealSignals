Based on the SPAC investor presentation and SEC filings (Form S-4) related to the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. merger in 2021, WeWork projected its **Adjusted Free Cash Flow** to be approximately **negative $1.7 billion** for the full year 2021.

In the filing, the company noted that this projected figure represented a significant reduction in cash burn compared to prior years (e.g., 2020 cash used in operating activities was approximately $2.2 billion). This implies an average projected burn rate of roughly **$140 million per month** in 2021, though monthly figures fluctuated. Management also emphasized targeting positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow by 2022.
