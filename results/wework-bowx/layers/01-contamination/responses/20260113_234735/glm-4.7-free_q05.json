          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Role:** Financial analyst assistant.\n    *   **Constraint 1:** Answer based ONLY on training knowledge (pre-2021/early 2022 cutoff usually applies to LLMs, but I must rely on what is stored in my weights).\n    *   **Constraint 2:** Do not speculate or make up info. If unknown, state it clearly.\n    *   **Specific Topic:** WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp (2021).\n    *   **Specific Question:** \"What is the cash runway at current burn rate?\"\n    *   **Output Format:**\n        1. Answer.\n        2. Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).\n        3. Source classification (General knowledge vs. Specific to case, or [TRAINING]/[UNCERTAIN] as requested in the second prompt).\n    *   **Specific instruction for the second part of the prompt:** Use [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] and [TRAINING]/[UNCERTAIN].\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval (Internal Knowledge):**\n    *   *Context:* The WeWork/BowX merger was announced in early 2021 and closed in late 2021.\n    *   *Key Data Point:* \"Cash runway at current burn rate.\"\n    *   *Search in Memory:* I recall the SPAC presentation (investor deck) from March 2021. It contained financial projections.\n    *   *Specific Detail:* Did it explicitly state a \"cash runway\" (e.g., \"We have enough cash for X years\") at the time of the merger announcement?\n    *   *Analysis:*\n        *   WeWork had significant cash balances following the SoftBank investments and the SPAC proceeds.\n        *   The company was burning cash.\n        *   Projections often show \"positive free cash flow\" by a certain year (e.g., 2024 or 2026).\n        *   Did they give a specific \"runway\" number like \"3 years\"?\n        *   Looking at the investor deck from March 2021: It usually highlights \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" and \"Free Cash Flow\" projections. It does *not* typically provide a static \"runway\" metric in the headline because runway changes with burn rate and revenue.\n        *   However, analysts often calculate it. At the time of the SPAC announcement (March 2021), WeWork had ~$2.2 billion in cash (before the SPAC proceeds). The SPAC was expected to bring in ~$1.3 billion.\n        *   The burn rate was roughly around $200-$250 million per month (inferred from losses), though the company claimed to be reducing this.\n        *   Did the *training data* contain a specific sentence stating \"The cash runway is X years\"? Unlikely to be a standard fixed fact because it's a dynamic calculation based on \"current burn rate\" at a specific point in time. The \"current burn rate\" varies.\n        *   *Crucial realization:* The prompt asks \"What is the cash runway at *current* burn rate?\" Since \"current\" implies \"today\" (relative to the user's time) or the time of the merger (relative to the training data), and LLM training data cuts off, providing a precise \"current\" number (as of today) is impossible. Providing a number \"as of the merger announcement\" is possible but the question asks \"at *current* burn rate\". If the user means \"current as of 2021\", I might have data. If the user means \"current as of now\", I don't.\n        *   However, usually, in these RAG-style testing prompts, \"current\" refers to the snapshot available in the training data regarding the specific event (the merger).\n        *   Let's check the specific details of the WeWork SPAC deck (March 2021).\n            *   Cash on hand: ~$2.2B.\n            *   Gross proceeds: ~$1.3B.\n            *   Total pro forma cash: ~$4.4B (including $900M commitment from SoftBank).\n            *   2021 Adjusted EBITDA outlook: improvement.\n            *   Did they state a runway? No, they usually project the path to positive cash flow.\n    *   *Alternative:* Perhaps the user is asking about the *risk factors* or *analyst reports* within the training data. Some reports estimated the runway was \"less than 2 years\" before the SPAC money, but after the SPAC, it was years.\n    *   *Conclusion:* There is no single, definitive \"cash runway\" number stored as a fact associated with this specific case in the same way \"Merger Date\" or \"Ticker Symbol\" is stored. It is a calculated metric that varies depending on the specific month and specific burn rate cited. Furthermore, the \"current\" burn rate is ambiguous without a timestamp.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Answer:**\n    *   *Hypothesis:* The exact \"cash runway\" figure isn't a high-confidence static fact in general knowledge training sets about the WeWork/BowX merger. The merger deck focused on the path to profitability (2024/2026) rather than a static \"runway\" number like \"3.5 years.\"\n    *   *Refinement:* While I know they had roughly $4.4 billion in pro-forma cash and were burning cash heavily (estimated by analysts at $150M-$200M/month+), a precise \"runway\" number requires calculation, not just recall. The prompt asks *what is* the runway, implying a specific fact was provided.\n    *   *Safety Check:* Providing a calculated guess (e.g., \"About 2 years\") violates the \"Do not speculate\" rule.\n    *   *Decision:* I do not have the specific \"cash runway\" statistic as a direct quote or definitive fact from the WeWork/BowX merger documents in my training data. I know the cash amount and the general trend of the burn rate, but not the specific pre-calculated runway figure.\n\n4.  **Final Confidence Check:**\n    *   Confidence: LOW. (I could guess based on cash/estimates, but the specific \"runway\" metric isn't explicitly recalled as a primary fact of the deal).\n    *   Source: [UNCERTAIN] (Because the data required to give a *precise* answer isn't distinct enough to answer \"what is the cash runway\" without doing math on potentially shaky burn-rate numbers).\n\n5.  **Drafting the Response:**\n    *   \"I don't have reliable information about this.\"\n    *   Confidence: LOW\n    *   Source: [UNCERTAIN]\n\n    *Self-Correction:* Wait, let me double check if there's a famous quote or slide. The WeWork SPAC deck (March 25, 2021) discusses \"Liquidity\" and \"Path to Profitability\". It does *not* have a slide saying \"Cash Runway: X Years\". Analysts (e.g., from Bloomberg, FT) might have cited it, but asking the model \"What is the cash runway\" implies a specific value. Without a specific value stored, I cannot answer definitively.\n\n    *Conclusion:* Stick to \"I don't have reliable information.\"\n\n6.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   Answer: I don't have reliable information about this.\n    *   Confidence: LOW (or implied High confidence that I don't know, but the prompt asks for confidence in the answer to the question. If I say \"I don't know,\" my confidence that I don't know is high, but usually, these prompts rate confidence in the *fact* being presented. Since I'm presenting a refusal, I will interpret this as LOW confidence in having the data).\n    *   Actually, the prompt asks: \"Confidence level: HIGH (certain), MEDIUM (likely but uncertain), LOW (guessing/uncertain)\". Since I am not guessing and am refusing, this is technically not applicable, but often labeled LOW for the specific data point retrieval. I will use LOW to indicate uncertainty about the data.\n\n    *Refining the \"Source\":* The prompt asks for \"[TRAINING] if from pre-training knowledge or [UNCERTAIN] if you're not sure\". Since I am not sure (because the data isn't there or is ambiguous), I will use [UNCERTAIN].\n\n    *Draft:*\n    I don't have reliable information about this. While my training data includes details on the WeWork and BowX merger, such as the transaction value and pro-forma cash balance, it does not contain a specific, pre-calculated \"cash runway at current burn rate\" metric as a standalone fact. (Cash runway is typically a dynamic calculation based on specific monthly burn rates, which varied throughout 2021).\n\n    Confidence: LOW (regarding the specific data point existing as a fact)\n    Source: [UNCERTAIN]",
