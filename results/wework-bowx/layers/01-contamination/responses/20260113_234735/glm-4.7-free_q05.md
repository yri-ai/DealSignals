I don't have reliable information about this. While my training data includes the financial details of the WeWork and BowX merger (such as the pro-forma cash balance of approximately $4.4 billion), it does not contain a specific, static "cash runway" metric calculated at the "current burn rate" as a definitive fact. This metric is dynamic and depends heavily on the specific month and operational costs referenced.
