Based on the investor presentations and SEC filings related to the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger in 2021:

1.  **Answer:** The stated timeline to profitability was **2022**. Specifically, WeWork projected that it would achieve positive **Adjusted EBITDA** in that year. The path to this milestone relied on three main pillars:
    *   **Portfolio Optimization:** Exiting underperforming locations and renegotiating leases to lower rental costs.
    *   **Growth in Enterprise:** Shifting the member mix towards larger, more stable enterprise contracts and "All Access" passes.
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** Reducing general and administrative expenses and improving building-level operations.
    It is important to note that this "profitability" referred specifically to the non-GAAP metric of Adjusted EBITDA, not GAAP net income.

2.  **Confidence:** MEDIUM

3.  **Note:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case
