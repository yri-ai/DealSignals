Based on my training data, the key assumptions underlying the financial projections presented during the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger in 2021 included:

1.  **Post-Pandemic Recovery:** The projections assumed a robust and sustained recovery in demand for office space following the COVID-19 pandemic, anticipating a return to work and urbanization trends.
2.  **Occupancy and Desk Growth:** The models assumed significant increases in occupancy rates and the number of desks sold (specifically targeting "All-in" revenue growth), relying on the expansion of enterprise memberships.
3.  **Adjusted EBITDA Profitability:** The projections assumed that WeWork would achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA by a specific future year (often cited as 2022 in their targets), driven by improved operational efficiency and "leverage" on fixed costs.
4.  **Shift to Asset-Light Model:** The financial forecasts assumed a successful transition toward a "asset-light" business model, shifting away from long-term lease liabilities toward management agreements and partnership structures, which was expected to improve free cash flow and margins.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
