I don't have reliable information about the specific dollar amount or percentage of the contribution margin per membership as cited in the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. merger documents. While I know that "Contribution Margin" was a key metric defined in the merger presentations (typically calculated as revenue less direct operating expenses, excluding specific items), I cannot confidently recall the specific numerical value reported per membership without risking inaccuracy between the 2019 IPO attempt data and the 2021 SPAC merger data.

- Confidence: HIGH (that I do not possess the specific reliable figure)
