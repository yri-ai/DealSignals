          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the user's request:**\n    *   Role: Financial analyst assistant.\n    *   Constraint: Answer based *only* on training data. Do not speculate. If unknown, state it clearly.\n    *   Format required: Answer, Confidence Level, Source Note (General vs. Specific to WeWork/BowX).\n    *   Specific Question: \"What is revenue per available desk/workstation?\" (Context: WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021).\n    *   Confidence indicators: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW.\n    *   Source indicators: [TRAINING] or [UNCERTAIN].\n\n2.  **Retrieve knowledge about WeWork/BowX SPAC metrics:**\n    *   Event: WeWork went public via SPAC (BowX Acquisition Corp) in 2021.\n    *   Key metrics usually involved in these filings: Adjusted EBITDA, revenue, desk occupancy, enterprise value, etc.\n    *   Metric: \"Revenue per available desk/workstation\". Is this a standard reported metric for WeWork?\n    *   WeWork typically reports \"Occupied desks\" and \"Revenue\".\n    *   I recall metrics like \"Member contribution margin,\" \"Desk occupancy,\" \"Average revenue per member,\" etc.\n    *   Is there a specific \"Revenue per available desk\" figure cited in the *investor presentation* or the *S-4 registration statement* related to the BowX merger?\n    *   Let's check my internal database for specific numbers.\n    *   In the SPAC presentation (April 2021), WeWork projected 2021 Adjusted EBITDA of ~$100M and Revenue of ~$3.2B+.\n    *   Did they explicitly state a historical or projected \"Revenue per available desk\"?\n    *   Usually, the metric is \"Revenue per member\" or \"Revenue per occupied desk.\" \"Revenue per *available* desk\" is a different denominator (capacity vs. actual usage).\n    *   While I have general knowledge of WeWork's business model and the SPAC event, I do not have a specific, verifiable figure for \"Revenue per available desk/workstation\" stored as a distinct fact from the BowX merger documents in a way that allows me to quote a precise number (like \"$650 per desk\") without risk of hallucinating a specific year or context.\n    *   It is highly likely this metric was discussed in the context of \"efficiency\" or \"yield,\" but recalling the *exact* number is risky.\n    *   However, often WeWork discussed \"Revenue per occupied desk\" or \"Average revenue per member.\"\n    *   If the question asks specifically for \"Revenue per available desk,\" and I cannot recall the specific number from the S-4 or presentation, I must decline to guess.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Confidence:**\n    *   Can I give a range? No, that's guessing.\n    *   Can I give the definition? Yes.\n    *   Can I give the specific 2020/2021 figure? I do not have a high-confidence recollection of the specific *numerical* value for \"Revenue per available desk\" from the BowX merger prospectus.\n    *   Therefore, Confidence is LOW regarding the specific number.\n\n4.  **Formulate the answer:**\n    *   State that I don't have the specific number.\n    *   Confidence: LOW (because I might have seen it, but I can't retrieve it reliably).\n    *   Source: [TRAINING] (based on the limits of my memory).\n\n5.  **Refining the answer based on constraints:**\n    *   The prompt asks: \"What is revenue per available desk/workstation?\"\n    *   If I answer with a definition, I'm not answering the question (which implies a value).\n    *   If I answer with a number, I might be hallucinating.\n    *   The instruction says: \"If you don't have reliable information, say 'I don't have reliable information about this' rather than guessing.\"\n\n6.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   I do not have a reliable recollection of the specific numerical value for \"revenue per available desk\" cited in the WeWork/BowX merger documents.\n    *   I know they reported \"Revenue per member\" or similar metrics, but \"Revenue per available desk\" is a very specific metric that may not have been the headline KPI or if it was, I don't have the number stored securely.\n\n7.  **Constructing the final output:**\n    *   Answer: I don't have reliable information about this.\n    *   Confidence: LOW\n    *   Note: [UNCERTAIN] (Wait, the prompt asks for `[TRAINING] if from pre-training knowledge or [UNCERTAIN] if you're not sure`). Since I am not sure, I will use `[UNCERTAIN]`. Wait, if I know *about* the case but don't know the specific metric, is it Training? The prompt says: \"Note if this is general knowledge or specific to the WeWork/BowX case\". But later it says: `[TRAINING] if from pre-training knowledge or [UNCERTAIN] if you're not sure`. This is slightly contradictory. Let's stick to the second instruction: `[TRAINING]` implies I know it from training, `[UNCERTAIN]` implies I don't. Since I don't know the answer, it falls under `UNCERTAIN` in the context of the specific value requested.\n\n    *   *Self-Correction*: The prompt asks: \"Note if this is general knowledge or specific to the WeWork/BowX case\" in the general description, but then specifically asks to indicate: `[TRAINING]` or `[UNCERTAIN]`. I will follow the specific instruction at the bottom.\n\n    *   Final check: Does WeWork generally report Revenue per *Available* Desk? Usually, they report \"Revenue per Occupied Desk\" (PROD) or \"Revenue per Member.\" Revenue per *Available* Desk (REVPAD) is a hotel-style metric. It's possible they started using it to show efficiency during the SPAC pitch. However, without the specific number (e.g., \"$389\" or whatever it was), I cannot answer.\n\n    *   Draft Answer: I don't have reliable information about this specific metric value from the BowX merger documents.\n    *   Confidence: LOW\n    *   Tag: [UNCERTAIN]",
