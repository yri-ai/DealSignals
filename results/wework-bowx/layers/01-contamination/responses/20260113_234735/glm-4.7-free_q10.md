**Answer:**
Occupancy rate is a metric used to measure the percentage of available space or desks that are currently occupied or under contract by members. In the context of WeWork, it is typically calculated as the number of desks occupied divided by the total number of desks available.

Regarding the trend surrounding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger in 2021:
*   **Pre-Pandemic:** Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, WeWork generally reported high occupancy rates, often above 80%.
*   **Pandemic Impact:** The occupancy rate dropped significantly during 2020 due to lockdowns and the shift to remote work. By the fourth quarter of 2020, occupancy had fallen to approximately 47% (down from 84% in the same quarter of 2019).
*   **SPAC Period (Early 2021):** Leading up to the SPAC merger announcement in early 2021, WeWork reported a trend of recovery, with occupancy rising to roughly 49% in the first quarter of 2021. Despite this upward trend, the occupancy rate remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.
