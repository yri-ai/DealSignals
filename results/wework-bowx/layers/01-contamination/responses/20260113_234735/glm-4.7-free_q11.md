**Answer:**
The **Member Churn Rate** is a metric that measures the percentage of members who cancel their memberships or leave the service over a specific period. It is typically calculated by dividing the number of members lost during the period by the average number of members during that period.

In the specific context of the **WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. SPAC merger (2021)**, WeWork reported on both "Member Churn" and "Desk Churn." WeWork highlighted that its Member Churn was improving (declining) as part of its turnaround story, but they often drew greater attention to "Desk Churn," which was lower (often reported in the single digits) than Member Churn (which was reported in the high teens) because desks represented the actual revenue-generating units being utilized.

- **Confidence level:** HIGH (on the definition and the distinction WeWork made between Member and Desk Churn in their financial reporting/presentations).
- **Note:** This is general financial knowledge applied to the specific context of the WeWork/BowX case.
