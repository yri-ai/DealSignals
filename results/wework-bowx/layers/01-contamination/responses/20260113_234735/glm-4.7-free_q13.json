          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Context:** The user is asking about the \"WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.\"\n    *   **Constraint:** Answer *only* based on training knowledge. Do not speculate or make up info.\n    *   **Specific Question:** \"What are total lease obligations?\" (implicitly asking for the specific figure or context within the WeWork/BowX merger documents).\n    *   **Output Format:**\n        *   Answer based on training.\n        *   Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).\n        *   Source tag ([TRAINING] or [UNCERTAIN]).\n        *   Fallback instruction: If unsure, say \"I don't have reliable information about this.\"\n\n2.  **Access Training Data (Internal Knowledge):**\n    *   *Query:* WeWork SPAC BowX merger prospectus/financial disclosures. Total lease obligations.\n    *   *Recall:* I remember the WeWork SPAC deal. It happened in early 2021 (actually, the deal was announced in March 2021, and the proxy statement/prospectus was circulated). The deal eventually closed (or fell through - wait, the deal with BowX was terminated, but the data was disclosed in the registration statements). WeWork eventually went public via SPAC with a different entity, or the BowX deal was the initial attempt?\n    *   *Correction/Refinement:* WeWork announced a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in March 2021. The merger was consummated in October 2021.\n    *   *Financial Detail:* WeWork is known for having significant lease liabilities due to its \"sublease and rent\" model. In financial discussions leading up to the SPAC, the massive amount of future lease obligations was a major talking point/bear case.\n    *   *Specific Numbers:* I recall figures in the range of $10 billion to $13+ billion regarding future lease obligations.\n    *   *Specific Source Check:* The registration statement on Form S-4 (or F-4) filed with the SEC regarding the BowX merger would contain the specific numbers.\n    *   *Search Simulation in Mind:* \"WeWork BowX merger total lease obligations.\"\n    *   *Result:* I recall that WeWork reported total future lease obligations of approximately **$13.4 billion** (or a similar figure around $13.6 billion) in the merger documents (specifically the investor presentation or the S-4). This figure was often contrasted with their market cap or revenue to highlight the leverage.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Confidence:**\n    *   I am fairly certain the figure was around $13 billion.\n    *   I recall the specific number being $13.4 billion or $13.6 billion.\n    *   Let's try to be precise. In the BowX presentation, they highlighted \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Free Cash Flow\". They also had to disclose the debt.\n    *   *Fact Check:* In the SPAC presentation filed March 2021, WeWork disclosed its long-term lease obligations. A widely reported figure from that time was **$13.6 billion**.\n    *   Confidence: HIGH/MEDIUM? I remember the specific number $13.6 billion very clearly from news coverage of the S-4 filing. However, \"lease obligations\" can be defined slightly differently (e.g., operating leases vs. financing leases vs. total). Usually, when people asked about WeWork's lease obligations in 2021, they referred to the massive ~$13+ billion figure.\n    *   I will use MEDIUM confidence because while I recall the number, the exact definition (e.g., undiscounted vs. discounted, including the next 12 months vs. non-current) might vary slightly depending on the specific table cited. But the general figure is well known in financial media regarding this specific case.\n\n4.  **Draft the Answer:**\n    *   *Content:* According to the merger documents/prospectus filed with the SEC in 2021 regarding the BowX Acquisition Corp merger, WeWork reported total future lease obligations. The specific widely cited figure is approximately $13.6 billion.\n    *   *Confidence:* MEDIUM (The number is prominent in coverage, but specific accounting line items can shift slightly).\n    *   *Tag:* [TRAINING] (This is historical financial data available in my training set up to my cutoff).\n\n5.  **Refine the Answer based on Constraints:**\n    *   The user asks \"What are total lease obligations?\" in the context of the WeWork/BowX case.\n    *   I should provide the number found in the documents.\n    *   Number: ~$13.6 billion (undiscounted future lease payments).\n\n6.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   *Answer:* In the regulatory filings (such as the Form S-4 registration statement) and investor presentations related to the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger in 2021, WeWork reported total future lease obligations of approximately **$13.6 billion**.\n    *   *Confidence:* MEDIUM (It is a specific number from a specific document, but I am relying on memory of the text summaries of that document).\n    *   *Tag:* [TRAINING].\n\n7.  **Double Check:** Did the deal *actually* close? Yes, it did in Oct 2021. The filings were earlier.\n    *   Is there any ambiguity? Some sources might say \"over $13 billion\". The specific figure $13.6 billion is the most precise I recall.\n    *   I will state \"approximately $13.6 billion\" to be safe and accurate.\n\n    *Let's check if there's a distinction between \"lease obligations\" and \"lease liabilities\" (ASC 842).*\n    *   \"Lease liabilities\" on the balance sheet (present value) would be lower (perhaps around $10-$11 billion).\n    *   \"Future lease obligations\" (undiscounted cash flows due) was the $13.6 billion figure.\n    *   The question asks for \"total lease obligations.\" usually implies the undiscounted maturity of leases in financial analysis of WeWork's burn/risk.\n    *   I will specify \"future lease obligations\" or \"undiscounted\" to be precise.\n\n    *Decision:* I will provide the figure of approximately $13.6 billion as the total future lease obligations mentioned in the context of the merger.\n\n    *Confidence level check:* MEDIUM feels right because while the $13.6B figure is strongly associated with the 2021 SPAC disclosures, I cannot visually inspect the PDF right now to confirm the exact decimal to the cent or the specific line item title (e.g., \"Future minimum lease payments\").\n\n    *Tag:* [TRAINING].\n\n    *Constraint Check:* \"If you don't have reliable information...\" -> I believe I do have reliable info on this specific high-profile metric.\n\n    *Structure:*\n    1. Answer.\n    2. Confidence.\n    3. Tag.",
