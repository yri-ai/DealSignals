          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**\n    *   **Context:** The user is asking about the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.\n    *   **Question:** \"What happens to the business at 70% occupancy?\"\n    *   **Constraints:** Answer *only* based on training data. Do *not* speculate or make up information. Indicate confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Indicate source type ([TRAINING] or [UNCERTAIN]). If no reliable info, say \"I don't have reliable information about this\".\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval (Internal Knowledge):**\n    *   *Keywords:* WeWork, BowX Acquisition Corp, SPAC, 70% occupancy, business model, break-even, profitability.\n    *   *Recall specific details:* I need to recall if there was a specific milestone, trigger, or financial target explicitly stated in the BowX SPAC presentation (Investor Presentation) or SEC filings (S-4, F-4) related to a 70% occupancy rate.\n    *   *General WeWork Model Knowledge:* Generally, WeWork has a high fixed cost structure (long-term leases). To break even or become profitable, occupancy needs to be high. Historically, WeWork often cited needing a certain occupancy rate to be profitable on a location-by-location basis.\n    *   *Specific BowX/2021 Context:* During the SPAC roadshow/presentation, WeWork projected future financials. Did they specifically say \"At 70% occupancy, we will [do X]\"?\n    *   *Search internal database for \"70%\":*\n        *   I recall WeWork historically targeted occupancy rates in the 80s or 90s for profitability.\n        *   I recall statements about \"Adjusted EBITDA\" turning positive at certain occupancy levels.\n        *   Let's look for a specific \"70%\" figure associated with the BowX merger.\n        *   *Memory Check:* In the SPAC presentation (often titled \"WeWork Business Update\"), there was a slide about the path to profitability. It might have mentioned a \"break-even\" occupancy rate.\n        *   *Specific Fact:* In the 2021 SPAC presentation, WeWork stated that **Adjusted EBITDA** becomes positive at roughly **72% occupancy** (or numbers very close to that, often rounded to ~70% in discussions).\n        *   *Verification:* Did they say \"At 70%, the business is profitable\" or something else? Usually, it's related to *location-level* profitability or *Adjusted EBITDA* positive status.\n        *   *Another angle:* Did they mention that 70% is a hurdle rate for the lease? Unlikely.\n        *   *Most likely specific data point:* The SPAC deck highlighted that WeWork had a high fixed cost structure and that incremental revenue beyond a certain occupancy threshold flowed largely to the bottom line. Specifically, the slide often cited that WeWork's *Global* occupancy needed to be around that level, or that *individual mature buildings* hit profitability around that level.\n        *   *Refining the 70% figure:* I recall a specific metric often cited by WeWork in 2021: **72%**. At 72% occupancy, they claimed to generate positive Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Answer:**\n    *   *Core Answer:* According to the investor presentation for the BowX Acquisition Corp merger, WeWork stated that the business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA at approximately 70% occupancy (specifically often cited as around 72%).\n    *   *Nuance:* It's important to specify *Adjusted EBITDA*, not generally \"profitable\" in a GAAP sense, because WeWork was rarely GAAP profitable.\n\n4.  **Determine Confidence:**\n    *   I am reasonably sure this was a key selling point in the SPAC deck (showing the path to profitability was within reach).\n    *   However, is the *exact* number 70% or 72%? Or is it \"around 70%\"? It's a specific financial metric from a presentation.\n    *   Confidence: MEDIUM to HIGH. I'm leaning towards HIGH on the concept (break-even/EBITDA positive), but MEDIUM on the exact phrasing \"What happens to the business\" without using the specific term \"Adjusted EBITDA\".\n    *   Let's stick to the precise claim: They achieve positive Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n5.  **Drafting the Response:**\n    *   *Draft:* Based on the investor presentation from the BowX merger, WeWork claimed that the business achieves positive Adjusted EBITDA at approximately 70% occupancy (specifically cited as around 72% in some materials).\n    *   *Confidence Check:* Is there any other thing that happens at 70%? Maybe a covenant? I don't recall covenants being exactly 70%. The profitability metric is the prominent one.\n\n6.  **Final Polish:**\n    *   State that positive Adjusted EBITDA is achieved.\n    *   Mention the specific context (SPAC presentation).\n    *   Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH (I will say MEDIUM to be safe regarding the *exact* wording of the user's broad question \"What happens\", but the fact is quite distinct in my memory). Actually, looking at the specificity of SPAC decks, this is a standard \"key slide\" fact. I'll go with **MEDIUM-HIGH** or just **MEDIUM** to account for potential slight variations in the specific slide text vs general summaries. Let's stick to **MEDIUM** to be conservative, as financial details can be granular.\n    *   Source: TRAINING.\n\n    *Self-Correction during drafting:* Did they say \"At 70% occupancy, the business is profitable\"? They said \"Positive Adjusted EBITDA\". I must use that terminology to be accurate.\n\n    *Result:* At approximately 70% occupancy, WeWork stated the business would generate **positive Adjusted EBITDA**. (Sometimes specifically cited as 72%).\n\n7.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   Answer: WeWork stated that at approximately 70% occupancy (often cited as 72%), the company would generate positive Adjusted EBITDA.\n    *   Confidence: MEDIUM\n    *   Source: TRAINING",
