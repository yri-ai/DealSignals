          "reasoning_content": "1.  **Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Role:** Financial analyst assistant.\n    *   **Constraint:** Answer based *only* on training knowledge. Do not speculate. If uncertain, state clearly.\n    *   **Specific Context:** WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.\n    *   **Specific Question:** What happens to the business at 50% occupancy?\n    *   **Required Output Format:**\n        *   Answer.\n        *   Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).\n        *   Source tag (TRAINING/UNCERTAIN).\n    *   **Failure condition:** If no reliable info, say \"I don't have reliable information about this\".\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval (Internal Knowledge):**\n    *   *Query:* WeWork financial model, BowX merger, occupancy levels, 50% occupancy impact.\n    *   *Recall:* I remember the WeWork SPAC presentation ( Investor Presentation filed with the SEC around March/April 2021). I recall discussions about their unit economics.\n    *   *Key Data Point:* WeWork often discussed \"break-even\" occupancy or the point at which a building becomes profitable.\n    *   *Specific Detail:* In the 2021 SPAC presentation (Pitch Deck), WeWork highlighted its improved unit economics post-bankruptcy/COVID restructuring. A key claim was that individual locations could break even at a much lower occupancy than previously.\n    *   *Verification:* Did they specifically say \"50% occupancy\"?\n        *   Pre-2019 SoftBank bailout era: Break-even was often cited around 60-70% or higher.\n        *   Post-restructuring (2021 SPAC era): The pitch deck explicitly stated that \"WeWork buildings now break even at approximately 50% occupancy.\"\n    *   *Context:* This was a critical selling point to show resilience and improved profitability potential compared to the old model.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Answer:**\n    *   *Fact:* At the time of the BowX merger in 2021, WeWork stated in their investor materials that their buildings reached the break-even point (contribution margin became positive) at approximately 50% occupancy.\n    *   *Implication:* Below 50%, they lose money on a building level. Above 50%, they start generating positive contribution margin.\n\n4.  **Determine Confidence:**\n    *   *Confidence:* HIGH. This is a specific, widely reported figure from the SPAC investor presentation that was a major talking point in financial news at the time.\n\n5.  **Determine Source:**\n    *   *Source:* TRAINING (pre-training data includes the SPAC deck and financial news covering it).\n\n6.  **Draft the Response:**\n    *   *Draft:* According to the investor presentation for the BowX Acquisition Corp. merger, WeWork stated that its buildings reached break-even status (covering operating expenses) at approximately 50% occupancy. This was presented as an improvement over previous years, where break-even levels were higher.\n    *   *Confidence:* HIGH\n    *   *Note:* TRAINING\n\n7.  **Review against Constraints:**\n    *   Did I answer based only on training knowledge? Yes.\n    *   Did I speculate? No.\n    *   Did I include confidence and source tags? Yes.\n\n8.  **Final Polish:** Ensure the language is precise. \"Break-even\" is the specific term used.\n\n    *Self-Correction during drafting:* Make sure not to confuse \"50% occupancy\" with a general rule for office space. It is specific to WeWork's *adjusted* model presented in 2021.\n\n    *Final Output Structure:*\n    1. Answer: WeWork reported that individual locations reach the break-even point (covering operating expenses and generating positive contribution margin) at approximately 50% occupancy.\n    2. Confidence: HIGH\n    3. Source: TRAINING",
