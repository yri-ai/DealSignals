          "reasoning_content": "The user is asking for the \"implied enterprise value\" of the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.\nThe user explicitly restricts me to using *only* training data and *not* making up information.\nI need to provide the answer, a confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and indicate if it's from TRAINING.\n\n1.  **Retrieve Knowledge:** I recall that WeWork announced a merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in early 2021.\n2.  **Recall Specifics:**\n    *   The deal was announced around March 2021.\n    *   The valuation figure was a key talking point.\n    *   I remember the Pro Forma Enterprise Value (or implied enterprise value) being widely reported as $9 billion.\n    *   Sometimes figures like $10 billion (equity value) were thrown around, but the enterprise value was specifically $9 billion.\n3.  **Verify:** Is this consistent with general financial news from that time period? Yes, major outlets (WSJ, Bloomberg, CNBC) reported the transaction valued WeWork at around $9 billion (enterprise value). This was a significant drop from its previous peak valuation ($47 billion) but a step up from its distressed valuation just prior to the SPAC announcement.\n4.  **Formulate Answer:**\n    *   Answer: The implied enterprise value was approximately $9 billion.\n    *   Confidence: HIGH. This is a very specific, well-documented fact from my training data regarding major financial news in 2021.\n    *   Source: TRAINING.\n\n5.  **Constraint Check:**\n    *   \"Based ONLY on what you know from your training data\": Yes.\n    *   \"Do NOT make up information\": Yes.\n    *   \"Indicate [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] confidence\": Yes.\n    *   \"Indicate [TRAINING]\": Yes.\n\n6.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   Answer: $9 billion.\n    *   Confidence: HIGH.\n    *   Source: TRAINING.",
