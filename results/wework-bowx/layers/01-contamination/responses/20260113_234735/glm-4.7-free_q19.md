**Answer:**
Based on my training knowledge, the valuation used to justify the WeWork SPAC merger price relied primarily on **future financial projections** (specifically Adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth for 2022 and 2024) and a **comparable company analysis (Comps)**. The presentation argued that WeWork deserved a valuation premium over traditional real estate companies (like REITs) due to its technology platform, instead warranting a comparison to high-growth, technology-enabled service companies. The price was effectively justified by applying a multiple to these projected Adjusted EBITDA figures.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
