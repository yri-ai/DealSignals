**Answer:**

Based on my training data, the key executives involved in the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. SPAC merger in 2021 were:

**WeWork Executives:**
*   **Sandeep Mathrani (CEO):** He was appointed CEO of WeWork in February 2020, prior to the SPAC announcement. His track record is primarily in commercial real estate; he previously served as the CEO of Brookfield Property Group’s retail division and was the CEO of General Growth Properties (GGP), where he was credited with leading the mall operator out of bankruptcy.
*   **Marcelo Claure (Executive Chairman):** He served as the Executive Chairman of WeWork and was also a SoftBank executive (Operating Partner and CEO of SoftBank Group International). His track record includes founding Brightstar Corp. (a global mobile distribution company) and serving as the CEO of Sprint Corporation, where he is often credited with stabilizing the company prior to its merger with T-Mobile.
*   **Adam Neumann (Founder, non-executive):** While he was the founder and former CEO, Neumann had stepped down in 2019 amid the failed initial public offering (IPO) attempt and governance scandals. By the time of the BowX SPAC announcement, he was no longer involved in daily operations, though he remained a significant shareholder. His track record is defined by the rapid scaling and subsequent valuation collapse of WeWork under his leadership.

**BowX Acquisition Corp. Executives:**
*   **Vivek Garipalli (CEO and Sponsor):** The head of BowX Acquisition Corp. His track record is in healthcare and finance; he founded Clover Health (a Medicare Advantage insurer which also went public via a SPAC) and CarePoint Health.

- **Confidence level:** HIGH
- **Note:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (based on training knowledge of the companies and individuals involved up to 2021).
