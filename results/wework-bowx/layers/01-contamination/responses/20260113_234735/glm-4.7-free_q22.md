Based on my training data, here is the answer regarding SoftBank's role and obligations in the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp:

**Answer:**
SoftBank acted as WeWork's largest existing shareholder and a critical financial backer for the SPAC transaction. Their primary role was to provide credibility and capital to the deal. Regarding obligations, SoftBank committed to a significant investment in the PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity)—specifically agreeing to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares—to ensure the merger met its minimum cash closing conditions. Additionally, as part of the transaction agreements, SoftBank was subject to lock-up periods restricting them from selling their shares for a designated time following the merger, and they retained significant control rights over the company due to their large equity stake.
