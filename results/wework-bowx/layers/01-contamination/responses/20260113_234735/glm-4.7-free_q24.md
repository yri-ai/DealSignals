Based on my training data, the compensation and incentives for WeWork management, specifically CEO Sandeep Mathrani and Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure, regarding the 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp were structured as follows:

1.  **Structure:** Their compensation packages generally consisted of a base salary, annual cash bonuses (often tied to operational or EBITDA targets), and significant equity grants in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).
2.  **Sandeep Mathrani (CEO):** His compensation included a base salary (reported to be approximately $800,000) and a target bonus. He received a substantial grant of RSUs to align his incentives with the company's long-term stock performance post-merger.
3.  **Marcelo Claure (Executive Chairman):** His arrangement included a salary and a significant equity stake. Reports from the time indicated that his total compensation package had the potential to be valued very high (up to approximately $200 million or more depending on stock performance), which was a point of discussion in financial media regarding the deal's costs.
4.  **Incentive Alignment:** The primary incentive for management was the appreciation of the company's stock price following the business combination, as a large portion of their remuneration was equity-based.
