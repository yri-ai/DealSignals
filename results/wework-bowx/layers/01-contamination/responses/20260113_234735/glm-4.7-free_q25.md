Based on the 2021 SPAC merger documentation between WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp, Adam Neumann held the title of **Non-Executive Chairman**. However, he did not have an operational role or day-to-day management responsibilities within the company. His exposure was primarily financial, as he remained a significant shareholder. Additionally, under the merger terms, he retained certain governance rights, such as the ability to nominate a member to the board of directors, subject to specific voting agreements and a lock-up period on his shares.
