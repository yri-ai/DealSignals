Based on the Form S-4 registration statement and related prospectus regarding the business combination between WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. filed in 2021, here are the top disclosed risk factors:

1.  **History of Financial Losses and Negative Cash Flow:** WeWork disclosed a history of significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations, raising substantial doubt about its ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
2.  **Impact of COVID-19:** The pandemic was a major risk factor cited, specifically regarding its negative impact on the demand for office space, members' ability to pay rent, and the potential for prolonged remote work trends reducing the necessity for physical coworking spaces.
3.  **Obligation Under Long-Term Leases:** The company highlighted the risk associated with its long-term lease obligations (liabilities) compared to the short-term nature of its member agreements (assets), creating a potential mismatch in financial maturity.
4.  **Ability to Execute Growth Strategy:** Risks were cited regarding the company’s ability to grow its brand, manage its global expansion, and successfully integrate new locations.
5.  **SPAC-Specific Risks:** These included the possibility that the merger would not be completed, the risk that existing shareholders would redeem their shares (reducing the gross proceeds of the transaction), and the dilution to public shareholders resulting from the SPAC structure.
