Based on my training data, here is the answer regarding material litigation or disputes related to the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger:

**Answer:**
Yes, there were material litigation and disputes. Specifically, WeWork faced ongoing securities class action lawsuits stemming from its failed 2019 initial public offering (IPO) and the disclosures regarding its business practices. Additionally, following the announcement of the merger with BowX Acquisition Corp., shareholder lawsuits were filed against BowX. These plaintiffs alleged that the company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties, claiming the proxy statement was misleading and that the $9 billion valuation of WeWork was unfair to shareholders.
