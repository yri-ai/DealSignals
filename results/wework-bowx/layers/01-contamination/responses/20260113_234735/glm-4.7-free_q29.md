**Answer:**
Based on my training data, the auditors (Ernst & Young) identified a **material weakness** in WeWork's internal control over financial reporting. This finding was disclosed in the registration statement related to the SPAC merger. Specifically, the auditors noted that WeWork did not maintain an effective control environment, particularly regarding the design and operating effectiveness of controls over complex accounting areas like lease accounting. Consequently, management concluded that these internal controls were not effective as of the end of the fiscal year.
