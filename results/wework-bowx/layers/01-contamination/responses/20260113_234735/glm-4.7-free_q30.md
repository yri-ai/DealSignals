**Answer:**
Yes, WeWork disclosed material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in the registration statement (Form S-4) related to the BowX Acquisition Corp. merger. Specifically, the company acknowledged that it did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. These weaknesses were attributed to a lack of qualified personnel, insufficient segregation of duties, and deficiencies in the review of financial reporting. While the company stated in the 2021 filings that it had implemented remedial measures to address these issues, the existence and history of these material weaknesses were a significant component of the risk factors and disclosures provided to investors during the merger process.
