Based on my training knowledge regarding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. merger, the board of directors following the closing of the business combination was composed of 11 members.

The key members designated for the board included:

*   **Marcelo Claure:** Executive Chairman (representing SoftBank)
*   **Sandeep Mathrani:** CEO and Director
*   **Vivek Ranadivé:** Chairman and CEO of BowX Acquisition Corp.
*   **Daniel Ek:** Founder and CEO of Spotify
*   **Mark Schwartz:** SoftBank Group International CEO
*   **Nirav Tolia:** Co-founder of Nextdoor and partner at BowX
*   **Lewis H. Black:** Director of BowX
*   **Steven Langman:** Co-founder of Rhône Group
*   **Ronald Fish:** Chairman of Oaktree Capital Management

The composition generally consisted of a mix of existing SoftBank/WeWork leadership, BowX representatives, and new independent directors.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (The specific list of 11 directors was disclosed in the merger proxy and investor presentations, but board compositions can change rapidly after mergers; this answer reflects the composition agreed upon at the time of the merger closing).
