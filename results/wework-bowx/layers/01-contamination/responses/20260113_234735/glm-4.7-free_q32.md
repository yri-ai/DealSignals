Based on my training data regarding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger, here is the answer to your question:

**Answer:**
Post-merger, WeWork utilized a dual-class stock structure consisting of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
*   **Class A common stock:** Held by public shareholders, with **1 vote per share**.
*   **Class B common stock:** Held primarily by SoftBank and certain other early investors or insiders, with **20 votes per share**.

This structure ensured that SoftBank maintained effective control of the company following the transaction. Notably, Adam Neumann (WeWork's co-founder) did not retain the super-voting rights associated with the Class B shares; his holdings were converted to Class A shares (or otherwise treated as non-controlling), effectively removing his governance power.
