Based on my training data regarding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger in 2021, here is the answer to your question:

**Answer:**
The lock-up agreements generally restricted company insiders, sponsors, and early investors from selling their shares for a period of **180 days** following the closing of the business combination.

However, the agreements included provisions to allow for early release of these restrictions if specific price targets were met. The standard terms were:
1.  **Standard Lock-up:** 180 days for most shares.
2.  **Price Trigger (Early Release):** The lock-up restrictions could be terminated early (typically allowing shares to trade after the 150th day post-closing) if the stock price traded at or above **$12.00 per share** for at least 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period.
3.  **Sponsor Lock-up:** The shares held by BowX Acquisition Corp's sponsors were generally locked up for **365 days**, but this also shortened to 180 days if the $12.00 price trigger condition was satisfied.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
