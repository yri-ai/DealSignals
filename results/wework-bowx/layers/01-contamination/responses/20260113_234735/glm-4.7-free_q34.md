Based on the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp merger documentation (such as the S-4 registration statement) in my training data, the registration rights generally include the following:

*   **Demand Rights:** Holders of the shares issued in the private investment in public equity (PIPE) typically have the right to demand that WeWork file registration statements covering their shares for resale.
*   **Piggyback Rights:** PIPE investors and the sponsor (BowX) generally have the right to include their shares in registration statements that WeWork initiates for its own purposes or for other shareholders (often subject to reduction by the underwriter).
*   **Form S-3/Shelf Rights:** Upon WeWork becoming eligible, holders typically have the right to request that their shares be included on short-form registration statements on Form S-3.

These rights are standard in SPAC transactions to allow early investors and sponsors to liquidate their positions.
