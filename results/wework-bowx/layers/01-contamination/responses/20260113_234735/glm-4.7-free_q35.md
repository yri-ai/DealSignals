**Answer:**
At the time of the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. merger agreement in March 2021 (and its subsequent closing in October 2021), the market context was defined by a historic boom in SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies). This period saw record volumes of capital flowing into blank-check companies as an alternative to traditional IPOs, fueled by low interest rates, ample liquidity, and speculative fervor in growth stocks.

Broader financial markets were optimistic about the post-pandemic economic recovery, driven by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and massive fiscal stimulus. However, the commercial real estate and flexible workspace sectors specifically faced headwinds and uncertainty. The persistence of remote and hybrid work models cast doubt on the future demand for office space. Consequently, despite the bullish "risk-on" environment, WeWork's implied valuation of roughly $9 billion was a steep discount from the $47 billion valuation it sought during its failed 2019 IPO attempt, reflecting lingering investor skepticism regarding its profitability and business model.
