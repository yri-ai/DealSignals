Based on the investor presentations and registration statements (S-4) associated with the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. merger in 2021, the strategy for addressing lease obligations was described as a "Portfolio Optimization" intended to shift the company toward a "Capital-Light" model.

Specifically, the strategy involved:

1.  **Exits:** Terminating leases at underperforming or non-core locations to reduce the liability burden.
2.  **Restructuring:** Renegotiating terms with existing landlords to lower fixed rent costs.
3.  **Conversion:** Converting traditional fixed-rent leases into variable structures, such as revenue-sharing agreements or management-style partnerships (where the landlord acts as a partner), to align costs with revenue generation.

The capital raised via the SPAC was intended to provide the liquidity necessary to support operations while these lease modifications were executed, rather than serving as a direct financial "refinancing" of the lease obligations into new debt instruments.
