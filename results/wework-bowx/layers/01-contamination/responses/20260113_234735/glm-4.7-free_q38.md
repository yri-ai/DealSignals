Based on my training data regarding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger in 2021:

Since BowX was a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (a "blank check" company), there were no traditional post-merger operational integration plans between two operating businesses. The primary change was WeWork becoming a publicly traded entity listed on the NYSE under the ticker "WE."

Regarding planned business model changes, WeWork outlined the following strategies in their investor presentations and filings at the time:
*   **Path to Profitability:** A primary focus was accelerating the path to positive Adjusted EBITDA, which they projected to achieve by 2022.
*   **Enterprise Focus:** Shifting the sales strategy to target larger enterprise clients to increase the stability and scale of revenue.
*   **Product Expansion:** Growing the "All Access" membership product, which allows members to access various locations rather than a single dedicated desk, aiming to increase flexibility and utilization rates.
*   **Capital Structure:** Moving toward a more "asset-light" model by reducing capital expenditures and management commitments, often by shifting away from long-term, master leases in favor of management agreements or shorter-term structures where possible.
