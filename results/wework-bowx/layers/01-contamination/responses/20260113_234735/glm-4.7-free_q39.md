Based on my training data regarding the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp. SPAC merger in 2021, the debt agreements (part of a broader restructuring involving SoftBank and other creditors) included specific financial and operational covenants designed to preserve cash and prioritize debt repayment.

The key covenants and restrictions included:

1.  **Minimum Liquidity Covenant:** This was a central requirement in the 2021 financing. WeWork was required to maintain a specific minimum level of cash and cash equivalents (liquidity). This restriction was intended to ensure the company could sustain operations while working toward profitability. Failure to maintain this threshold could trigger defaults or restrict access to capital.
2.  **Restricted Payments:** The agreements placed strict limits on "restricted payments," which typically include dividends on equity stock, redemptions of equity, and other distributions to shareholders. This was to ensure that available cash was used for operations and debt service rather than returning capital to owners.
3.  **Limitations on Indebtedness:** WeWork was restricted from incurring additional debt or issuing certain guarantees unless specific conditions were met (often referred to as "incurrence-based" covenants or baskets). This prevented the company from further levering its balance sheet without lender approval.
4.  **Asset Sales and Mergers:** Standard covenants restricted the ability to sell substantial assets or merge with other entities without the consent of the lenders, protecting the collateral backing the loans.
