**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
Cash burn rate is the rate at which a company uses up cash (typically measured as net cash used in operating activities and/or free cash flow outflow) over a period—often expressed per month or per quarter. It’s essentially how quickly the company is “burning” its cash balance before it needs additional funding.
