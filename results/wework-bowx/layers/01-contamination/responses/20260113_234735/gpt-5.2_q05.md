I don’t have reliable information about the **cash runway at the current burn rate** for WeWork at the time of the **2021 BowX SPAC merger**, because it depends on specific contemporaneous figures (cash on hand and current/forward burn) that I can’t verify from my training data without risking fabrication.

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Case specificity:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (not general knowledge)
