I don’t have reliable information about the specific “key assumptions underlying the projections” used in the WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger materials (e.g., the exact operational/financial drivers and quantified assumptions presented in their investor presentation/projections).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This is **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (not general knowledge).
