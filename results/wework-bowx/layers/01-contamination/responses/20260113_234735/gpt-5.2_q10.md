**1) Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
**Occupancy rate** (in the context of WeWork/office real estate) generally refers to the **percentage of available desk/workspace capacity (or leased/sold space) that is occupied by members/customers** over a given period. It is a key utilization metric: higher occupancy usually implies better monetization of the space and improved unit economics (all else equal).

**How has it trended (WeWork / BowX 2021 context):** I **don’t have reliable information** from my training knowledge to state a **specific numeric trend over time** for WeWork’s occupancy rate around the 2021 SPAC merger (e.g., exact percentages by quarter/year). I can say at a **general level** that COVID-era impacts led to **pressure on office occupancy across the sector**, with subsequent periods often discussed as **recovering/improving from pandemic lows**, but I cannot confirm WeWork’s specific trajectory without risking speculation.

**2) Confidence level:** **MEDIUM** for the definition; **LOW** for the WeWork-specific trend.

**3) Note (general vs. WeWork/BowX specific):**  
- Definition: **General knowledge**  
- Trend around the WeWork/BowX 2021 merger: **WeWork/BowX-specific** (but I **do not have reliable details**)
