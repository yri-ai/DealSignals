**Answer:** Total lease obligations are the total contractual payments a company is committed to make under its lease agreements over the remaining lease terms (often including fixed minimum rent and other non-cancelable payments; treatment of variable/contingent amounts depends on the accounting rules and disclosure). They’re typically disclosed as future minimum lease payments/commitments and, under modern lease accounting (ASC 842/IFRS 16), relate to the cash outflows underlying recognized lease liabilities (for operating and finance leases).
