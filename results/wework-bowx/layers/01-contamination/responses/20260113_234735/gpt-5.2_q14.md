I don’t have reliable information about the specific **duration profile of WeWork’s lease commitments** in the context of the **2021 BowX SPAC merger** (e.g., a breakdown by maturity buckets/weighted-average remaining lease term as presented in the merger materials).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source tag: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This is **specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, not general knowledge.
