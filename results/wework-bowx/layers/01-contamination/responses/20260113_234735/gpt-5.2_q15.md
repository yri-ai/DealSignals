I don’t have reliable information about the specific **lease termination provisions** (e.g., termination rights, penalties, conditions, timing) applicable to **WeWork’s leases** in connection with the **WeWork–BowX SPAC merger (2021)** from my training data. Lease termination terms are typically set out in individual lease agreements and summarized (if at all) in detailed SEC filings, and I can’t recall a definitive, case-specific description.

- **Confidence:** LOW  
- **Source tag:** [UNCERTAIN]  
- **Case specificity:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case (not general knowledge)
