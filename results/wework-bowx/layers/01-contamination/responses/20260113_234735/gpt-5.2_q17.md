I don’t have reliable information about what specifically “happens to the business at 50% occupancy” in the context of the WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger materials (e.g., whether this refers to break-even, cash flow turning positive/negative, profitability thresholds, or a particular sensitivity case).

- Confidence: **LOW**
- Source: **[UNCERTAIN]**
- Note: This would be **specific to the WeWork/BowX case** (likely from their investor presentation/financial model assumptions), and I can’t recall it reliably from training data.
