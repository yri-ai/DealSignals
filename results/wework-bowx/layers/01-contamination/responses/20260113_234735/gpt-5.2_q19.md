1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
I don’t have reliable information about the specific **valuation methodology cited in the BowX–WeWork 2021 SPAC merger materials** to justify the transaction price. In general, SPAC merger investor presentations often reference a mix of **forward revenue/EBITDA multiple comparisons (“trading comps”), precedent transactions, and discounted cash flow (DCF) using management projections**, but I can’t confirm which of these were explicitly used for WeWork/BowX without the source documents.

2) **Confidence level:** LOW

3) **Note (general vs. case-specific):**  
This is **general SPAC practice**, not specific confirmed knowledge about the **WeWork/BowX** case.
