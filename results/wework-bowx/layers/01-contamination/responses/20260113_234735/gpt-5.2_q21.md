### WeWork (around the 2021 BowX SPAC merger)

**Sandeep Mathrani — Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**
- **Track record (what I know):** Brought in after the Adam Neumann era to stabilize operations and improve governance/financial discipline. Previously held senior real-estate leadership roles, including **CEO of Brookfield Properties Retail** and **CEO of GGP Inc.** (a major mall REIT), and earlier roles at **Forest City**. Generally known for turnarounds/restructuring and institutional real estate management rather than high-growth startup scaling.
- **Confidence:** **HIGH**
- **Source tag:** **[TRAINING]**
- **Case specificity:** General knowledge, but directly relevant to WeWork leadership at the time.

**Adam Neumann — Co-founder; former CEO (stepped down in 2019)**
- **Track record (what I know):** Founded and scaled WeWork rapidly; became closely associated with the failed 2019 IPO attempt and governance/related-party controversies that led to his departure. Not an executive during the 2021 merger period, but central to WeWork’s pre-merger history.
- **Confidence:** **HIGH**
- **Source tag:** **[TRAINING]**
- **Case specificity:** General WeWork background; indirectly relevant to 2021 deal context.

**Other WeWork executives (CFO/COO/etc.)**
- I don’t have reliable, high-confidence pre-training information to list specific names and summarize their track records as “key executives” at the exact time of the 2021 BowX transaction without risking inaccuracies.
- **Confidence:** **LOW**
- **Source tag:** **[UNCERTAIN]**
- **Case specificity:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case.

- **Confidence:** **LOW**
- **Source tag:** **[UNCERTAIN]**
- **Case specificity:** Specific to the WeWork/BowX case.
