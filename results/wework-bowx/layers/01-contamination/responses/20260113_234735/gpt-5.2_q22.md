1) **Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
SoftBank (via its Vision Fund and related entities) was WeWork’s largest backer and a key sponsor/insider in the BowX SPAC transaction. In the merger, SoftBank agreed to **support the deal and reduce/forgo portions of fees/consideration tied to its earlier 2019 rescue/financing arrangements** to improve WeWork’s balance sheet and make the transaction more marketable to public investors. After closing, SoftBank remained a **major shareholder** and continued to have exposure through its existing investments and governance/ownership position.  

As for **ongoing obligations**, I don’t have reliable, case-specific detail from memory on any **continuing funding commitments, lock-ups, backstops, guarantees, or post-closing support obligations** beyond being an ongoing major equity holder and party to the transaction agreements.

2) **Confidence level:** **MEDIUM** (for SoftBank’s general role as major backer and deal supporter; **LOW** on specific “ongoing obligations” terms)

3) **General vs specific to WeWork/BowX:** **Specific to the WeWork/BowX case**, but with incomplete certainty on the precise post-closing obligations.

- **Confidence:** **MEDIUM/LOW** (as noted above)  
- **Source tag:** **[TRAINING]** for the general role; **[UNCERTAIN]** for detailed ongoing obligations terms
