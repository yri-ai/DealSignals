I don’t have reliable information about the full set of related-party transactions in the WeWork–BowX (2021) SPAC merger based solely on my training knowledge. **[LOW] [UNCERTAIN]**

General context I can state (not specific, and not a complete list for this deal): in SPAC mergers, “related-party transactions” often include sponsor promote/Founder Shares, private placement warrants purchased by the sponsor/affiliates, PIPE allocations to insiders/affiliates, advisory/placement fees paid to affiliated parties, and any arrangements involving significant shareholders (e.g., SoftBank for WeWork) such as support agreements, backstops, or side letters. But I cannot confirm which of these applied specifically to BowX/WeWork without the deal documents. **[LOW] [GENERAL KNOWLEDGE]**
