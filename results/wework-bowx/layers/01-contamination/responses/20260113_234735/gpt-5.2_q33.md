**Answer (based on training knowledge):**  
In the WeWork–BowX SPAC merger (completed in 2021), “lock-up agreements” refer to contractual restrictions that prevented certain shareholders—typically WeWork insiders (management/directors), the sponsor (BowX sponsor), and other significant pre‑merger holders—from selling or transferring their shares for a specified period after the business combination closed. These lock-ups are meant to limit immediate post‑merger selling pressure and align insiders/sponsors with longer-term performance.  

I **do not have reliable, specific information** from my training about the exact lock-up terms for this particular transaction (e.g., exact duration(s), which parties were covered, any performance/price-based early release triggers, or the precise share amounts).

**Confidence:** LOW
