**Answer (market context at deal time):**  
In 2021, the WeWork–BowX SPAC merger was announced/negotiated amid a very active (and increasingly volatile) SPAC market. SPAC issuance and deal-making had surged in late 2020 and early 2021, and by mid‑to‑late 2021 sentiment was cooling: regulators (notably the SEC) were increasing scrutiny of SPAC disclosures and accounting, many post‑merger (“de‑SPAC”) stocks were underperforming, redemptions were becoming more common, and investor appetite was shifting away from high-growth/story deals. The broader equity market was still relatively supportive of risk assets compared with pre‑pandemic levels, but the “SPAC boom” phase had clearly faded.
