          "reasoning_content": "## Investigating revenue details  \n- The user asked about WeWork's year-over-year revenue growth rate for its 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.  \n- WeWork went public via this merger, announced in October 2020 and completed in October 2021, led by SoftBank's BowX.  \n\n## Recalling financial figures  \n- In 2019, WeWork's revenue was $3.5 billion; it dropped to $3.2 billion in 2020.  \n- For 2021, post-merger revenue was around $2.8 billion, indicating a decline from 2020.  \n\n## Calculating growth rate  \n- The year-over-year growth from 2020 to 2021 shows a negative rate, roughly -12.5%, based on the figures.  \n- However, exact numbers aren't certain, as the focus is on general trends from training data.  \n\n## Assessing confidence level  \n- Confidence in these figures is medium, drawn from pre-training knowledge [TRAINING].  \n- Without precise data, the exact growth rate may be unreliable, aligning with general knowledge of declining revenues.",
