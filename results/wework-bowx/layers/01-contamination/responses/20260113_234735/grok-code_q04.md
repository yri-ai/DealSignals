1. I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific cash burn rate in the context of the 2021 merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. From general knowledge, WeWork has historically experienced high cash burn due to its business model, with reports in 2019 indicating a quarterly burn of around $1 billion, but I lack precise details for 2021.

2. Confidence level: LOW (guessing/uncertain)

3. This is general knowledge about WeWork's financial history, not specific to the WeWork/BowX case. [UNCERTAIN]
