          "reasoning_content": "## Investigating user query  \n- The user asked about WeWork's cash runway at the current burn rate following its 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.  \n- Cash runway refers to how long the company can operate with current cash based on its monthly burn rate, a key financial metric.  \n\n## Reviewing WeWork's financial history  \n- WeWork attempted an IPO in 2019 but withdrew due to poor reception, later merging with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 to go public.  \n- Post-merger in October 2021, WeWork faced significant financial challenges, reporting losses and high cash burn, leading to concerns about sustainability.  \n\n## Assessing available data  \n- I recall WeWork reported a $1.4 billion net loss in 2022 and had cash on hand, but specific figures for cash and burn rate around the merger are unclear.  \n- Reports suggest a cash position of around $1.5\u20131.7 billion by late 2021, but exact numbers for cash runway calculation are not reliably available.  \n\n## Concluding with confidence  \n- I don't have reliable, specific information on WeWork's cash runway at the time, so I cannot provide an exact figure.  \n- Confidence level: LOW, based on general pre-training knowledge [TRAINING], with uncertainty due to missing specifics [UNCERTAIN].",
