Based on my training knowledge, in the prospectus for the WeWork merger with BowX Acquisition Corp (filed as an S-4 with the SEC in 2021), WeWork outlined a path to profitability that included cost reductions (such as optimizing real estate leases and operational efficiencies), revenue growth through increased membership and enterprise sales, and expansion into new markets and services. The stated timeline was to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of 2023.
