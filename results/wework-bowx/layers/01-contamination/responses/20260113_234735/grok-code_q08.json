          "reasoning_content": "## Understanding the Query  \n- The user asked about WeWork's contribution margin per membership related to its 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.  \n- Contribution margin is revenue minus variable costs, often calculated per unit, but \"per membership\" seems specific to WeWork's business model.  \n\n## Assessing Available Knowledge  \n- WeWork is a coworking company that went public via a SPAC merger in 2021, but specific financial metrics like contribution margin per membership aren't in my training data.  \n- My knowledge cutoff is around 2023, and I lack real-time or proprietary data from SEC filings or reports.  \n\n## Formulating the Response  \n- I don't have reliable information on WeWork's contribution margin per membership and must state this clearly.  \n- The answer will include a confidence level of LOW, labeled as [TRAINING], since it relies on general pre-training knowledge.",
