1. I don't have reliable information about the specific contribution margin per membership for WeWork in the context of their 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. Contribution margin is a general financial concept (revenue minus variable costs), but I lack any specific figures or data from my training knowledge related to WeWork's memberships.

2. Confidence level: LOW (guessing/uncertain)

3. This is general knowledge about financial metrics, but specific to the WeWork/BowX case: UNCERTAIN (not from pre-training knowledge)
