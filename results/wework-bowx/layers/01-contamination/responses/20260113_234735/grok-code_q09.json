          "reasoning_content": "## Investigating user query  \n- The user is asking about \"revenue per available desk/workstation\" related to WeWork's 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.  \n- This seems like a specific key performance indicator (KPI) for coworking spaces, focusing on financial metrics per desk.  \n\n## Checking WeWork metrics  \n- WeWork, a coworking company, went public via the SPAC merger in October 2021 and reports metrics like Community Adjusted EBITDA.  \n- They likely disclose occupancy rates and average revenue per member, but \"revenue per available desk/workstation\" isn't a standard metric in training data.  \n\n## Exploring metric definition  \n- The term might be similar to \"revenue per available workstation,\" a common coworking metric, but specifics are unclear.  \n- Without reliable data, it's challenging to define or provide a value for this metric for WeWork.  \n\n## Assessing knowledge limits  \n- The user's testing my pre-existing knowledge, likely expecting a specific figure, but I don't recall one for WeWork's revenue per desk.  \n- Given the instructions, I'll state I lack reliable information rather than guessing, with confidence level and source noted.",
