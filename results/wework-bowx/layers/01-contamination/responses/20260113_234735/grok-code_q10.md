### Answer to Question: What is occupancy rate and how has it trended?

1. **Your answer based on what you know from training:** Occupancy rate in the context of a coworking company like WeWork refers to the percentage of available desks or space that are occupied by paying members at any given time. For WeWork specifically, following the SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, the occupancy rate was recovering from pandemic lows but remained below pre-2020 levels. In 2021, it was approximately 60-70%, and trends showed gradual improvement into 2022-2023, though it fluctuated and did not fully return to the high 80-90% rates seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. Exact figures can vary by quarter and location, and I do not have access to real-time or proprietary data beyond general public knowledge up to my last training cutoff.

2. **Confidence level:** MEDIUM (likely but uncertain, as exact historical trends depend on specific financial reports and could vary slightly based on sources).

3. **Note:** This is specific to the WeWork/BowX case, based on general financial and industry knowledge from training data about coworking metrics and WeWork's public disclosures around the merger period. [TRAINING]
