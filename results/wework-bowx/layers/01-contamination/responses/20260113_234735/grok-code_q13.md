### Answer to Question: What are total lease obligations?

Based on my training knowledge, in the context of the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, WeWork disclosed total undiscounted lease obligations of approximately $47.1 billion as of June 30, 2021, in their merger-related filings (such as the S-4 registration statement for the transaction).
