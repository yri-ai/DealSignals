### Answer to Question: What is the duration profile of lease commitments?

Based on my training knowledge, WeWork's lease commitments, as disclosed in their financial filings related to the 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, are significant and primarily consist of long-term operating leases for office spaces worldwide. The duration profile shows a breakdown of undiscounted future minimum lease payments, with a substantial portion of commitments extending beyond 5 years. For example, as of December 31, 2021, the total undiscounted lease commitments were approximately $47.3 billion, broken down roughly as follows (in millions):

- Within 1 year: $3,800
- Years 2-3: $8,700 (approximately $4,200 in year 2 and $4,500 in year 3)
- Years 4-5: $9,600 (approximately $4,700 in year 4 and $4,900 in year 5)
- Thereafter: $25,200

This profile reflects WeWork's business model of securing long-term leases to sublease spaces, leading to a heavy weighting toward later years.

- **Confidence level:** MEDIUM (I have general knowledge of the profile from public filings, but exact figures may vary slightly based on specific disclosures.)
