          "reasoning_content": "## Recalling WeWork's history  \n- WeWork attempted an IPO in 2019 but withdrew due to poor market reception.  \n- In 2021, WeWork went public through a SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp, announced in October and completed in November.  \n\n## Examining occupancy impact  \n- WeWork's revenue depends on leasing space and subleasing to members, making occupancy rates critical for financial health.  \n- At 50% occupancy, WeWork has historically operated at a loss, especially post-COVID, but specific merger-related triggers at this level aren't clear.  \n\n## Assessing merger terms  \n- The BowX-WeWork merger valued the company at about $9 billion, with warrants tied to stock price, not directly to occupancy.  \n- No reliable information found on specific outcomes at 50% occupancy in the merger agreement.  \n\n## Determining confidence level  \n- Lacking precise details, the response on 50% occupancy effects is [LOW] confidence, drawn from [TRAINING] knowledge up to 2023.  \n- Recommend stating, \"I don't have reliable information about this,\" given the uncertainty.",
