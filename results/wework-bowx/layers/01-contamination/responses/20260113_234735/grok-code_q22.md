### Answer:
SoftBank is a major investor and controlling shareholder in WeWork, holding a significant equity stake (approximately 80% prior to the 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp). In the context of the merger, SoftBank played a key role by committing to invest $1 billion in the merged entity as part of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) to support the transaction, which valued WeWork at around $9 billion. This investment was intended to provide capital for WeWork's operations and growth. Ongoing obligations for SoftBank include maintaining its investment commitments, participating in governance (such as board representation), and potentially providing additional funding if needed, though specific long-term contractual obligations beyond the merger terms are not detailed in my training knowledge.
