### Answer to Question: What related-party transactions exist?

Based on my training knowledge, the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021 involved disclosures of certain related-party transactions in the merger's SEC filings (such as the S-4 registration statement). These were primarily related to WeWork's historical operations and included:

- Leases and agreements with entities affiliated with Adam Neumann (WeWork's former CEO), such as his family companies or related entities, which were entered into at favorable terms (e.g., below-market rates or with other benefits).
- Investments and transactions involving SoftBank Group Corp., a major shareholder in WeWork, including prior share sales and financing arrangements.

These transactions were scrutinized for potential conflicts of interest and were disclosed in the merger documents to comply with SEC requirements for related-party transactions.

- **Confidence level:** MEDIUM (I recall these from general financial reporting on the merger, but details may vary and I don't have the exact filings memorized.)
- **[TRAINING]** This is from pre-training knowledge of public financial disclosures and news about the WeWork-BowX merger. If you need specifics, I recommend reviewing the official SEC filings for the most accurate and complete information.
