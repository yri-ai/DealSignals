### Answer to Question: What are the top disclosed risk factors?

Based on my training knowledge, the top disclosed risk factors in the BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork merger (as outlined in the Form S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC in 2021) include the following key categories. These are drawn from standard disclosures in such filings for WeWork's business model and the merger context:

1. **History of Significant Losses and Uncertainty About Profitability**: WeWork had a history of substantial operating losses, and there was no assurance it could achieve or sustain profitability, which could impact its valuation and operations.
2. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**: The pandemic significantly reduced demand for office space, leading to potential lease defaults, reduced revenue, and challenges in adapting to remote work trends.
3. **Dependence on Real Estate Leases and Key Markets**: WeWork's business relied heavily on long-term leases in major cities, exposing it to risks from lease expirations, renegotiations, or economic downturns affecting property values.
4. **Intense Competition**: Competition from other flexible office providers, coworking spaces, and traditional real estate could erode market share and pricing power.
5. **Regulatory and Legal Risks**: Potential changes in laws or regulations related to real estate, labor, or data privacy, as well as ongoing litigation from past issues (e.g., governance controversies under former leadership).
6. **Risks Related to the SPAC Merger**: Challenges in completing the merger, shareholder approval, integration issues, and dilution of ownership for existing shareholders.

These are the primary risk factors highlighted in the filing, prioritized based on their prominence and potential impact. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and actual filings should be reviewed for full details.

- **Confidence Level**: MEDIUM (I am familiar with standard risk disclosures in SEC filings for similar transactions, including WeWork's history, but exact wording and prioritization can vary slightly across sources).
- **Source Note**: [TRAINING] – This is based on pre-training knowledge of public SEC filings and financial reporting for the WeWork-BowX merger, which is specific to the case. If you need the exact text from the filing, I recommend consulting the original SEC documents.
