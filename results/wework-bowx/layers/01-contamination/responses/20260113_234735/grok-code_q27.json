This was specific to the WeWork/BowX case and was widely reported in financial news at the time.\n\n- [HIGH] confidence  \n- [TRAINING] (from pre-training knowledge)  \n\nThis is specific to the WeWork/BowX case. I do not have information on any ongoing or resolved disputes beyond what was publicly known as of my last training data cutoff. If there have been developments since then, I don't have reliable information about them.",
