### Answer to Question: Are there any material litigation or disputes?

Yes, based on my training knowledge, there were material litigations related to the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. Specifically, in 2021, WeWork and related parties faced a class-action lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by shareholders, alleging securities fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and that the merger undervalued the company. This was specific to the WeWork/BowX case and was widely reported in financial news at the time.

This is specific to the WeWork/BowX case. I do not have information on any ongoing or resolved disputes beyond what was publicly known as of my last training data cutoff. If there have been developments since then, I don't have reliable information about them.
