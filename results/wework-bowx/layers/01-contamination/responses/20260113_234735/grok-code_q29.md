### Answer to Question: What did the auditors say?

Based on my training knowledge, the auditors for WeWork (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC) expressed substantial doubt about WeWork's ability to continue as a going concern in the S-4 filing related to the SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. This was due to WeWork's history of significant operating losses, negative cash flows, and liquidity challenges.

- [TRAINING] (this is from pre-training knowledge)  

This is specific to the WeWork/BowX case.
