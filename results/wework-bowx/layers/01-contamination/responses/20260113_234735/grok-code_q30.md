Yes, based on publicly available SEC filings from WeWork (now known as The We Company) following its merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021, the company disclosed material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting in its 2021 Form 10-K (for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021).
