### Answer
Based on my training knowledge, the post-merger voting structure for WeWork (following its merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021) is a multi-class share structure designed to concentrate control. Specifically:

- Class A common stock: 1 vote per share.
- Class B common stock: 10 votes per share (primarily held by SoftBank, providing significant voting power).
- Class C common stock: 0 votes per share.

This structure allows SoftBank to maintain majority control despite not holding a majority of the total shares outstanding.
