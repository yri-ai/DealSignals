  "content": "### Answer to Question: What are the lock-up agreements?\n\nLock-up agreements in the context of the WeWork merger with BowX Acquisition Corp (a SPAC) in 2021 refer to contractual restrictions that prevent certain shareholders, particularly insiders like founders and early investors, from selling their shares for a specified period after the merger's completion. These agreements are designed to stabilize the stock price post-merger by limiting immediate selling pressure. Based on general knowledge of SPAC mergers and publicly reported details from the WeWork-BowX transaction, the lock-up period for key insiders, such as Adam Neumann and other WeWork founders, was typically 2 years from the merger date (October 2021), with some provisions allowing partial releases or extensions under certain conditions. However, specific terms could vary by shareholder group, and not all shares were subject to lock-ups.\n\n- [MEDIUM] confidence  \n- [TRAINING] (this is based on pre-training knowledge of SPAC structures and publicly available information about the WeWork-BowX merger, but exact details may have evolved or been subject to amendments not covered in my training data)",

          "reasoning_content": "## Investigating lock-up agreements  \n- The user is asking about lock-up agreements for the WeWork and BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger in 2021.  \n- These agreements typically prevent insiders from selling shares for 1-2 years post-merger to stabilize stock prices.  \n\n## Recalling WeWork specifics  \n- WeWork\u2019s 2021 merger with BowX included lock-up periods for founders and early investors, with Adam Neumann\u2019s shares locked for 2 years.  \n- The merger was announced in October 2020 and completed in October 2021, aligning with standard SPAC lock-up practices.  \n\n## Evaluating knowledge confidence  \n- Confidence in general SPAC lock-up knowledge is HIGH, based on pre-training [TRAINING].  \n- Confidence in specific WeWork details, like Neumann\u2019s 2-year lock-up, is MEDIUM, as it aligns with recall but lacks full verification [TRAINING].",
