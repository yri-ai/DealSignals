### Answer to Question: What are the lock-up agreements?

Lock-up agreements in the context of the WeWork merger with BowX Acquisition Corp (a SPAC) in 2021 refer to contractual restrictions that prevent certain shareholders, particularly insiders like founders and early investors, from selling their shares for a specified period after the merger's completion. These agreements are designed to stabilize the stock price post-merger by limiting immediate selling pressure. Based on general knowledge of SPAC mergers and publicly reported details from the WeWork-BowX transaction, the lock-up period for key insiders, such as Adam Neumann and other WeWork founders, was typically 2 years from the merger date (October 2021), with some provisions allowing partial releases or extensions under certain conditions. However, specific terms could vary by shareholder group, and not all shares were subject to lock-ups.
