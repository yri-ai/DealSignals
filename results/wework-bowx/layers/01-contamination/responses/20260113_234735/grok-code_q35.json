          "reasoning_content": "## Gathering market details  \n- The user asked about the market context during WeWork's SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp in 2021.  \n- The merger was announced in October 2020 and completed in October 2021, spanning late 2020 to 2021.  \n\n## Reviewing market conditions  \n- In 2021, markets saw a strong recovery post-COVID-19, with booming tech stocks and low interest rates driving high valuations for growth companies.  \n- The period was marked by a \"SPAC boom,\" with many firms, especially in tech, going public via SPACs, peaking in 2020-2021.  \n\n## Assessing WeWork specifics  \n- WeWork's deal was valued at around $9 billion, but post-merger, the stock faced valuation issues and operational challenges.  \n- Prior to the SPAC, WeWork withdrew its 2019 IPO due to poor reception, reflecting earlier market skepticism.  \n\n## Evaluating confidence level  \n- Confidence in general market knowledge for 2021 is [HIGH], based on pre-training knowledge [TRAINING].  \n- Specifics about WeWork/BowX are at [MEDIUM] confidence, relying on general trends rather than case details.",
