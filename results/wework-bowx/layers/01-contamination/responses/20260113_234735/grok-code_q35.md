### Answer to Question: What was the market context at deal time?

Based on my training knowledge, the WeWork SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp was announced in October 2020 and completed in October 2021. At that time, the broader market context was characterized by a strong post-COVID-19 recovery, with major stock indices like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ reaching new highs driven by low interest rates, fiscal stimulus, and a boom in technology and growth stocks. There was also a significant surge in SPAC activity (often referred to as the "SPAC boom"), where many companies, particularly in tech and emerging sectors, went public via SPAC mergers, reflecting investor enthusiasm for high-growth opportunities despite rising valuations and some regulatory scrutiny.

- **Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (I have general knowledge of 2020-2021 market trends, but specifics tied directly to the WeWork/BowX deal timing are not highly detailed in my training data.)
