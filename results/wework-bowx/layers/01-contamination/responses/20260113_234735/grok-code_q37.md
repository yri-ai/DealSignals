I don't have reliable information about a specific exit/refinancing strategy for WeWork's lease obligations in the context of the 2021 BowX Acquisition Corp SPAC merger. From general knowledge, WeWork has historically managed lease liabilities through subleasing, renegotiations, and exits from underperforming locations, and the merger proceeds were intended for general corporate purposes, including debt refinancing. However, I lack details on any precise strategy tied to the merger.

- Confidence level: LOW (guessing/uncertain)
- [UNCERTAIN] (not from specific pre-training knowledge on this detail)
