I don't have reliable information about WeWork's specific occupancy rate trends around the 2021 SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.

**Occupancy rate** (general knowledge): A metric showing the percentage of available space that is currently leased or in use. Calculated as: (occupied space ÷ total available space) × 100.

**Confidence**: [HIGH] for the general definition, [LOW] for WeWork-specific trends  
**Source**: [TRAINING] for the definition, [UNCERTAIN] for WeWork/BowX case
