I cannot determine WeWork's revenue for the most recent reported period from this document. 

The document appears to be a presentation that discusses WeWork's values, business model (including their All Access subscription offering), and various strategic elements, but it does not contain specific financial figures such as revenue numbers for any reporting period. The actual financial data that would show revenue figures is not visible or included in the portions of the document provided.

To find WeWork's most recent revenue, you would need to refer to their quarterly earnings reports, SEC filings (such as 10-Q or 10-K forms), or investor relations materials that contain detailed financial statements.
