I cannot determine the revenue growth rate year-over-year from this document. 

While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that includes various strategic information, company values, and business model details, the actual financial data and specific revenue figures that would be needed to calculate year-over-year revenue growth rates are not visible or included in the text portions provided.

To calculate a revenue growth rate, I would need:
- Revenue figures for at least two consecutive periods (years or quarters)
- Or an explicitly stated growth rate percentage

If you have access to the full document with visible charts, tables, or financial data sections, please share those specific pages or sections, and I'll be happy to help identify the revenue growth rate.
