I apologize, but I cannot determine the operating losses for the most recent period from this document. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation that contains mostly structural elements, company values, and business model descriptions, but the actual financial figures and numbers are not visible or included in the text provided.

To answer your question about operating losses, I would need access to the actual financial statements or slides that contain:
- Income statement data
- Specific dollar amounts for revenues and expenses
- The time period being referenced
- Operating loss figures

If you have access to the complete document with visible financial tables and charts, please share those specific pages or sections, and I'll be happy to help identify the operating losses.
