I cannot find specific information about the cash runway at current burn rate in the provided document. 

The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021 that covers company values, business strategy, and various operational metrics, but the specific financial details regarding:
- Current cash balance
- Monthly or quarterly burn rate
- Projected cash runway

are not visible or detailed in the portions of the document that are legible.

To answer this question accurately, I would need access to the financial statements or specific slides that contain:
- Cash and cash equivalents balance
- Operating cash flow or cash burn metrics
- Management's guidance on runway

If you have access to other sections of this presentation or WeWork's financial statements from this period, those would contain the relevant information.
