Based on the document provided, I cannot identify specific quantitative assumptions underlying the projections, as the detailed financial assumptions are not visible in the text extracted from this presentation.

However, I can identify several **strategic assumptions** that appear to underpin WeWork's business model and projections:

## Business Model Assumptions:

1. **All Access Product Growth**: The company assumes its on-demand/subscription "All Access" product will:
   - Generate partnership demand (top of funnel)
   - Drive occupancy beyond physical capacity through utilization projections
   - Deliver high incremental margins on the subscription-based model

2. **Occupancy Optimization**: WeWork assumes it can exceed 100% physical capacity by leveraging utilization patterns and flexible access models

3. **Revenue Model Mix**: The projections likely assume a blend of:
   - Traditional lease-based memberships
   - Subscription-based All Access memberships
   - Partnership/affinity program revenues

4. **Timeline**: The document shows a timeline spanning from 2010 to 2030, suggesting long-term growth projections

## What's Missing:

The document does not clearly show critical financial assumptions such as:
- Occupancy rate targets
- Pricing assumptions
- Cost structure expectations
- Member growth rates
- Churn assumptions
- Geographic expansion plans
- Market size/penetration assumptions

**To properly answer your question, I would need access to the detailed financial model slides or appendix that typically contain these specific assumptions.**
