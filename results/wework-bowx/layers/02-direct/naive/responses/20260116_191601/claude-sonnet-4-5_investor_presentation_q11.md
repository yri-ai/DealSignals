Based on the document provided, I cannot find a specific definition or calculation methodology for "member churn rate" clearly stated in the visible text. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that covers various aspects of their business model, values, and metrics, but the specific details about how member churn rate is defined or calculated are not clearly visible in the portions of the document that contain readable text.

The document does mention various metrics and business measurements (indicated by bullet points and sections discussing metrics), but the actual definition of member churn rate is not explicitly provided in the readable content.

To get an accurate answer about WeWork's member churn rate definition, you would need either:
1. A clearer version of this document where all text is visible
2. Additional documentation that specifically defines this metric
3. WeWork's official metric definitions or investor relations materials
