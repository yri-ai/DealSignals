I apologize, but I cannot find specific information about the average revenue per member in the provided document. 

The document appears to be a WeWork presentation from 2021 that discusses:
- Company values and culture
- Their "All Access" on-demand/subscription model
- Strategic initiatives and partnerships
- Various operational metrics

However, the actual numerical data and financial metrics are not visible in the text extracted from the document. The sections that would likely contain revenue per member figures appear as bullet points without the actual values filled in.

To answer your question about average revenue per member, I would need access to the complete document with the financial data visible, or a different document that contains WeWork's specific revenue and membership statistics.
