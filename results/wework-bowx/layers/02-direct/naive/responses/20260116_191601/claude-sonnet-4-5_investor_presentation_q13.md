I cannot find specific information about total lease obligations in the provided document. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that includes information about their business model, values, and strategy, but the specific financial details regarding total lease obligations are not visible or included in the excerpted content provided.

To answer your question about total lease obligations, I would need access to WeWork's financial statements or sections of the document that specifically detail their lease commitments and obligations.
