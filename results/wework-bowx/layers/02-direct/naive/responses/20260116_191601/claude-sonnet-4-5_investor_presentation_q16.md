I cannot find any specific information in this document about what happens to the business at 70% occupancy. 

The document appears to be a WeWork presentation that discusses their business model, values, and the "All Access" on-demand membership product, but it does not contain visible text or data points that explicitly reference a 70% occupancy threshold or its impact on the business.

The document mentions that the All Access product "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections," but it doesn't specify particular occupancy percentage thresholds or their business implications.

If you're looking for information about occupancy breakeven points or specific performance metrics at different occupancy levels, that information may be in a different section of the presentation that isn't clearly visible in the provided pages.
