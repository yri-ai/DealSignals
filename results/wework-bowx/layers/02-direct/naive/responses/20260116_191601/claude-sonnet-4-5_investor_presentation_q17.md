I cannot find specific information in the provided document about what happens to WeWork's business at 50% occupancy.

The document does mention that WeWork's "All Access" on-demand/subscription model "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections," but it does not provide details about business performance at any specific occupancy threshold, including 50%.

To answer your question about the business implications at 50% occupancy, I would need additional financial data such as:
- Break-even occupancy rates
- Revenue per occupied desk/office
- Fixed vs. variable cost structure
- Contribution margins at different occupancy levels

This information is not contained in the sections of the document that are visible/readable in what you've provided.
