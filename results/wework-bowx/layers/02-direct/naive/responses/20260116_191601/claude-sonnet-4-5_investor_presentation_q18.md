I cannot determine the implied enterprise value from this document. 

The document appears to be a WeWork presentation from 2021 that contains mostly corporate values, business strategy information, and general company descriptions. While there are some financial metrics and bullet points referenced throughout, the specific numerical data needed to calculate enterprise value (such as market capitalization, debt, cash, or explicit enterprise value figures) is not visible or included in the extracted text.

To answer this question, I would need access to:
- Market capitalization or equity value
- Total debt
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Or a directly stated enterprise value figure

If this information exists in the original document, it may be in charts, tables, or specific financial sections that weren't clearly captured in the text extraction.
