Based on the document provided, I cannot identify a specific valuation methodology used to justify a price. 

The document appears to be a WeWork corporate presentation from 2021 that includes:
- Company values and mission statements
- Business model descriptions (including their "All Access" on-demand subscription service)
- Various operational metrics and strategic information
- Timeline references spanning 2010-2030

However, the actual content discussing valuation methodologies, financial models, or pricing justification is not visible in the extracted text. The document shows many placeholder bullet points (●, •, ○) and references to confidential slides, but the specific valuation details are either:

1. Not included in the portions of the document that were extracted, or
2. Present only in visual elements (charts, tables, graphics) that weren't captured in the text extraction

To answer your question about valuation methodology, I would need access to the complete content of the financial or valuation sections of this presentation.
