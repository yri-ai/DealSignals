Based on the provided document, I cannot identify any specific comparable transactions or companies that are cited. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation that discusses the company's values, business model (including their All Access on-demand product), and various operational aspects. However, the actual content on most pages is not visible or legible in the format provided - I can only see headers indicating "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." and occasional bullet points without the detailed text.

To answer your question about comparable transactions or companies, I would need to see the actual content of the slides, particularly any sections that might discuss:
- Market analysis or competitive landscape
- Valuation methodologies
- Industry benchmarking
- M&A activity or transaction comparables

If you have access to a clearer version of this document or can point me to specific pages that contain comparable company or transaction analysis, I would be happy to provide more detailed information.
