Based on the provided document, I cannot identify specific key executives or their track records. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that focuses primarily on:

- Company values and culture
- Business model elements (All Access subscription product)
- Strategic initiatives and operational metrics
- Financial frameworks and definitions

**What the document does NOT contain:**
- Names of executives or leadership team members
- Biographical information
- Professional backgrounds or previous experience
- Track records or performance histories of specific individuals

To answer your question about WeWork's key executives and their track records, I would need access to different documents such as:
- Investor presentations with management team sections
- Proxy statements (DEF 14A filings)
- Executive biographies
- Press releases about leadership appointments
- SEC filings like S-1 or 10-K documents that typically include management sections

If you have access to other WeWork documents that contain information about the leadership team, I'd be happy to analyze those for you.
