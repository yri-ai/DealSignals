Based on the provided document, I cannot find specific information about SoftBank's role and ongoing obligations. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that focuses on:
- WeWork's company values and culture
- Their "All Access" on-demand workspace product
- Business model and operations
- Various strategic and operational metrics

While SoftBank has historically been a major investor in WeWork, this particular document does not contain visible details about SoftBank's specific role, investment terms, or ongoing obligations to WeWork.

To answer your question accurately, I would need access to:
- Investment agreements or shareholder documents
- Sections of the presentation that specifically discuss investor relationships
- Financial statements showing SoftBank's ownership stake and commitments

If you have access to other documents or different pages from this presentation that contain investor information, I'd be happy to help analyze those.
