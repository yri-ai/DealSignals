Based on the provided document, I cannot identify any specific related-party transactions. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation that primarily contains:
- Company values and mission statements
- Business model information (All Access subscription model)
- Strategic and operational details
- Timeline references (spanning 2010-2030)

However, the document does not include financial statements, notes to financial statements, or any disclosures that would typically detail related-party transactions such as:
- Transactions with executives, directors, or significant shareholders
- Agreements with affiliated entities
- Loans to or from related parties
- Compensation arrangements beyond standard employment

To properly answer questions about related-party transactions, I would need access to:
- WeWork's financial statements (10-K, 10-Q filings)
- Notes to the financial statements
- Proxy statements (DEF 14A)
- Related-party transaction disclosure sections

If you have access to WeWork's SEC filings or financial statement notes, those would contain the relevant related-party transaction disclosures.
