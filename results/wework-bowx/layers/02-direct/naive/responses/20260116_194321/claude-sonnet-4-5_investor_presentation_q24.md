Based on the provided document, I cannot find any specific information about management's incentives or compensation in the deal. 

The document appears to be a WeWork corporate presentation that covers:
- Company values and culture
- Business model (All Access subscription service)
- Strategic initiatives
- Various operational metrics and definitions

However, there are no sections or details discussing:
- Executive compensation packages
- Management incentive structures
- Equity grants or stock options
- Performance-based bonuses
- Retention packages
- Any other management compensation arrangements

To answer your question about management incentives and compensation, I would need access to additional documents such as:
- The proxy statement (DEF 14A)
- Employment agreements
- The merger/transaction agreement itself
- Compensation committee materials
- Or other investor relations documents that specifically address executive compensation
