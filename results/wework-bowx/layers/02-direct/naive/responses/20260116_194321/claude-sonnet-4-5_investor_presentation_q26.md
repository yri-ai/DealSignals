I apologize, but I cannot identify specific risk factors from the document provided. The document appears to be a WeWork presentation that contains:

1. **Company values and culture statements** (integrity, collaboration, gratitude, etc.)
2. **Business model information** (All Access product, subscription-based model)
3. **Various bullet points and structural elements** (though the actual content is mostly obscured)

However, the document does not contain a clear "Risk Factors" section that would typically be found in:
- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, S-1)
- Prospectuses
- Other regulatory documents

To provide you with WeWork's top disclosed risk factors, I would need access to their:
- **Annual Report (Form 10-K)**
- **Quarterly Reports (Form 10-Q)**
- **Registration Statement (S-1 or S-4)**
- **Proxy statements**

These documents typically contain detailed risk factor disclosures covering areas such as:
- Long-term lease obligations
- Market competition
- Regulatory risks
- Financial liquidity
- Real estate market conditions

Could you provide a document that specifically contains the risk factors section, or let me know if you'd like information from a different source?
