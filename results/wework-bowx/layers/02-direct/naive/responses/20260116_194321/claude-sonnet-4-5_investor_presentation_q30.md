Based on the provided document, I cannot find any information about material weaknesses in internal controls. 

The document appears to be a WeWork corporate presentation from 2021 that focuses on:
- Company values and mission
- Business model (All Access membership)
- Growth timeline
- Operational metrics and definitions

There is no discussion of internal controls, audit findings, or material weaknesses in this presentation. Information about material weaknesses in internal controls would typically be found in:
- Annual reports (10-K filings)
- Quarterly reports (10-Q filings)
- SOX compliance sections
- Audit committee reports

To answer your question about material weaknesses in internal controls, you would need to review WeWork's SEC filings or formal financial reporting documents rather than this business presentation.
