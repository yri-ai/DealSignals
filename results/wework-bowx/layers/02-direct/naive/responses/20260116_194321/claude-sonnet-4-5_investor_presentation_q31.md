I cannot find information about the board composition post-merger in the provided document. 

The document appears to be a WeWork presentation from 2021 that focuses on:
- Company values and culture
- Business model (including their "All Access" subscription offering)
- Various strategic and operational aspects

However, there is no visible content regarding board composition, board members, or governance structure following any merger. The document may be incomplete, or this information may be contained in sections that were not fully rendered in the version provided.

To answer your question about board composition post-merger, I would need access to additional documentation such as:
- Proxy statements
- Merger agreement details
- Corporate governance documents
- SEC filings related to the transaction
