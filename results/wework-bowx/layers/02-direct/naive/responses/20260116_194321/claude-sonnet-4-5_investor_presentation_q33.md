Based on the provided document, I cannot find any specific information about lock-up agreements. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation that covers the company's values, business model (including their All Access offering), and various operational aspects, but it does not contain details about lock-up agreements.

Lock-up agreements are typically arrangements that prevent insiders, early investors, or employees from selling their shares for a specified period (usually following an IPO or major transaction), but this particular document does not address this topic.

If you're looking for information about WeWork's lock-up agreements, you would need to refer to other documents such as:
- SEC filings (S-1, S-4, or 8-K forms)
- The prospectus or registration statement
- Merger or acquisition agreements
- Shareholder agreements
