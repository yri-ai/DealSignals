Based on the provided document, I cannot find any specific information about registration rights. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation focused on:
- Company values and culture
- Business model (All Access membership)
- Operational metrics and strategy
- Various business aspects

However, there is no content visible in this document that discusses registration rights, which are typically found in:
- Stockholder agreements
- Investment agreements
- Securities registration documents
- Corporate governance documents

To answer your question about registration rights, I would need access to WeWork's:
- Investor Rights Agreement
- Registration Rights Agreement
- Securities filings (S-1, S-4, etc.)
- Stockholder agreements

If you have access to these specific legal or securities documents, I'd be happy to help identify and explain the registration rights provisions contained within them.
