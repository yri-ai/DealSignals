Based on the document provided, I cannot determine the specific market context at deal time. 

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 that includes:
- Company values and mission statements
- Information about their "All Access" on-demand workspace product
- Various business metrics and strategic points
- Timeline references spanning 2010-2030

However, the document does not contain explicit information about:
- The specific deal being referenced
- Market conditions at the time of any particular transaction
- Economic context or industry dynamics
- Competitive landscape details

To answer your question about market context at deal time, I would need additional information specifying which deal you're referring to (such as the 2021 SPAC merger, a specific acquisition, or another transaction) and access to sections of the document that discuss market conditions, which are not visible or detailed in the provided pages.
