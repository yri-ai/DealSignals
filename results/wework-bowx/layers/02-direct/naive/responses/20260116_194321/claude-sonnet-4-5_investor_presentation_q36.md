Based on the document provided, I cannot definitively determine whether comparable transactions were disclosed. 

The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or corporate overview from 2021, but the actual content of most pages is not visible in the text provided - only headers showing "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." and some bullet points without the accompanying text.

The visible content focuses on:
- WeWork's values and mission
- Their "All Access" business model
- Timeline spanning 2010-2030
- Various strategic elements and metrics

However, without being able to see the full content of each page, I cannot confirm whether there is a section discussing comparable transactions (such as comparable company analyses, precedent transactions, or M&A comparables) that would typically be found in valuation or strategic transaction materials.

**Answer: Cannot be determined from the visible content in this document.**
