Based on the document provided, I cannot find specific information about an exit or refinancing strategy for WeWork's lease obligations.

The document appears to be a presentation that covers:
- WeWork's core values and mission
- Their "All Access" on-demand/subscription product
- Various operational metrics and partnerships
- Growth projections (timeline shown from 2010-2030)
- Business model advantages (high margins, subscription-based revenue)

However, the document does not explicitly detail:
- Lease obligation exit strategies
- Refinancing plans for existing lease commitments
- Lease restructuring approaches
- Balance sheet management related to lease liabilities

To answer your question about exit/refinancing strategy for lease obligations, I would need access to:
- WeWork's financial statements or investor materials specifically addressing debt and lease obligations
- Management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections
- Debt/liability refinancing presentations
- Strategic restructuring plans

If this information is critical for your analysis, I recommend reviewing WeWork's SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K), investor presentations focused on financial restructuring, or their bankruptcy/restructuring documents if applicable.
