Based on the document provided, I can identify several business model changes and strategic initiatives that were planned, though specific "post-merger integration" details are not explicitly outlined. Here are the key business model elements mentioned:

## Business Model Changes/Initiatives:

1. **All Access Product**
   - On-demand pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription model
   - Provides access to global network of locations
   - Designed to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity based on utilization projections
   - Subscription-based model with high incremental margins

2. **Strategic Benefits of All Access:**
   - Generates partnerships through affinity programs to create top-of-funnel demand
   - Allows optimization of occupancy rates across the portfolio
   - Creates significant incremental margins on top of traditional leased business

3. **Core Values Transformation**
   The document emphasizes operating principles around:
   - Integrity and trust-building
   - Shared purpose and continuous improvement
   - Bold action and resilience
   - Community building and collaboration

## Limitations:
The document appears to be a presentation deck with many redacted sections (indicated by bullet points without text). The specific details about:
- Integration timelines
- Operational consolidation plans
- Specific merger-related changes
- Financial targets or restructuring plans

...are not visible in the provided excerpts.

The focus appears to be on evolving from a traditional lease-based model to a more flexible, subscription-based platform model with the All Access product as a key differentiator.
