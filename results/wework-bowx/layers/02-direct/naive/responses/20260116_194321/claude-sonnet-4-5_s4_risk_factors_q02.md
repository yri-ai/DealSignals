To calculate the revenue growth rate year-over-year, I need to look at WeWork's historical revenue data from the Selected Historical Financial Information section.

From the Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:

**Revenue figures:**
- Year ended December 31, 2020: $3,415,865 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2019: $3,458,592 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2018: $1,821,751 thousand

**Calculating year-over-year growth rates:**

**2019 to 2020:**
Growth Rate = (($3,415,865 - $3,458,592) / $3,458,592) × 100
Growth Rate = (-$42,727 / $3,458,592) × 100
Growth Rate = **-1.2%**

**2018 to 2019:**
Growth Rate = (($3,458,592 - $1,821,751) / $1,821,751) × 100
Growth Rate = ($1,636,841 / $1,821,751) × 100
Growth Rate = **89.9%**

**Summary:**
- Revenue **declined 1.2%** from 2019 to 2020 (from $3.46 billion to $3.42 billion)
- Revenue **increased 89.9%** from 2018 to 2019 (from $1.82 billion to $3.46 billion)

The revenue decline in 2020 was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on WeWork's business operations.
