Based on the document, I cannot provide a specific calculation of cash runway at current burn rate. However, I can share relevant financial information:

**Key Financial Metrics:**

**Cash Position (as of June 30, 2021):**
- Total cash: $506.3 million
- Trust account available: ~$483.1 million (before Business Combination)

**Cash Flow Performance:**
- Six months ended June 30, 2021: Net cash used in operating activities of $(1,158.957) million
- Year ended December 31, 2020: Net cash used in operating activities of $(857.008) million

**Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP):**
- Six months ended June 30, 2021: $(1,312.099) million
- Year ended December 31, 2020: $(2,298.240) million

**Post-Business Combination:**
The document indicates that upon closing of the Business Combination, WeWork would receive:
- Up to ~$483 million from BowX's trust account (less any redemptions)
- $800 million from the PIPE investment
- Total potential available cash of approximately $1.28 billion (assuming no redemptions)

The Merger Agreement includes a Minimum Available Cash Condition of $800 million at closing.

However, the exact cash runway would depend on multiple factors including:
- The success of ongoing restructuring efforts
- Changes in operational cash burn
- Amount of public stockholder redemptions
- Timing of the Business Combination closing

The document does not provide a specific cash runway projection.
