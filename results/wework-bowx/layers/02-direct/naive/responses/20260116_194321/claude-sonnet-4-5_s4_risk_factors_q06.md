Based on the document, there is **no specific timeline or detailed path to profitability explicitly stated**. However, here's what the document reveals about WeWork's approach to profitability:

## Management's Strategic Focus

1. **New Strategic Direction**: Following the withdrawal of their 2019 IPO, WeWork implemented "a transformation in its business plan under new management" emphasizing:
   - Achieving positive **Adjusted EBITDA** through expense management
   - Streamlined operations
   - Optimizing existing real estate portfolio
   - Executing well on current pipeline before seeking growth opportunities

2. **Uncertain Outcome**: The document explicitly states:
   > "While the Company has initiated and substantially completed a strategic restructuring with the goal of creating a leaner, more efficient organization to support its long-term goal of sustainable growth, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in realizing the benefits of this plan."

## Historical Context

- WeWork had an **accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2021**
- Net losses of:
  - $3.0 billion (six months ended June 30, 2021)
  - $3.8 billion (2020)
  - $3.8 billion (2019)
  - $1.9 billion (2018)

The document contains a risk factor explicitly titled: **"The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in accordance with GAAP)."**

**In summary**: No specific timeline or detailed path to GAAP profitability is provided in this document.
