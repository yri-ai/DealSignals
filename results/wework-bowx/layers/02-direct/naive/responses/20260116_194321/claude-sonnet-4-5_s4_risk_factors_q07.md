I apologize, but I cannot find specific key assumptions underlying projections in the provided document. The document contains extensive information about:

1. **Business Combination structure** - the merger between BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork Inc.
2. **Financial statements and metrics** - historical financial data for both companies
3. **Risk factors** - numerous risks related to the business
4. **Transaction terms** - details about shares, warrants, and consideration

However, I did not locate a dedicated section with forward-looking financial projections (such as revenue, EBITDA, or cash flow forecasts) along with their underlying assumptions.

The document does mention:
- **Pro forma information** showing scenarios with "No Redemption" and "Maximum Redemption"
- **Historical financial metrics** including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow
- **References to management's strategic plans**, including optimization efforts and achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA

But these are not the same as detailed financial projections with stated assumptions about growth rates, margin improvements, capital expenditures, market conditions, etc.

If you're looking for specific financial projections that may have been shared with investors, these would typically be found in investor presentations, fairness opinions, or separate disclosure schedules that may not be included in this proxy statement/prospectus excerpt.
