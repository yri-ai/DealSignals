I don't have enough information in the provided document to calculate the contribution margin per membership. The document is primarily a proxy statement/prospectus (Form S-4/A) for a business combination between BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork Inc. While it contains extensive information about the transaction structure, financial statements, and various operational metrics, I cannot find the specific revenue and direct cost data needed to calculate contribution margin per membership.

To calculate contribution margin per membership, I would need:
1. Revenue per membership
2. Direct costs attributable to each membership (such as location-specific costs)

While the document mentions membership numbers and revenue figures in various sections, it doesn't present this data in a format that would allow me to calculate a meaningful contribution margin per membership figure.
