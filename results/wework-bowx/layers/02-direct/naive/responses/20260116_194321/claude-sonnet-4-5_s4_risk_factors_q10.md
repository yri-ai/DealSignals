Based on the document, I cannot find any information about occupancy rate or how it has trended. 

The document does mention "Physical Occupancy" once in the definitions section, where it defines it as "the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations," but this metric is not discussed or reported anywhere else in the document with actual values or trends.

The document does provide information about membership changes, noting that "between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%," but this is a membership metric rather than an occupancy rate.
