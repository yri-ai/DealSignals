According to the document, the member churn rate is not explicitly stated as a single percentage figure. However, the document provides several relevant pieces of information about membership changes and churn:

1. **Membership Decline**: Between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, WeWork's total memberships (including ChinaCo, IndiaCo, and Israel locations) declined by **16%**.

2. **Month-to-Month Memberships**: During the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately **10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments** that could be terminated in any given month.

3. **Renewal Rate**: During the same period, approximately **6% of physical memberships (excluding month-to-month commitments) came up for renewal each month** on average.

4. **Relocation Retention**: As of June 30, 2021, the company retained approximately **90% of relocated members**, though this is specific to members who were moved to nearby buildings due to lease amendments and exits.

The document mentions that WeWork "experienced a reduction in new sales volume" and "higher levels of membership agreement terminations" due to COVID-19, but it does not provide a specific overall churn rate percentage for the company.
