To calculate the average revenue per member, I need to find revenue data and membership information from the document.

From the Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork section, I can find:

**Revenue:**
- Six months ended June 30, 2021: $1,191,331 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2020: $3,415,865 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2019: $3,458,592 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2018: $1,821,751 thousand

However, the document does not provide specific membership numbers for these periods in the sections I've reviewed.

The document mentions:
- "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%."

But it doesn't provide the actual number of members for any specific period that would allow me to calculate average revenue per member.

**Answer: The document does not provide sufficient information to calculate the average revenue per member. While revenue figures are provided for various periods, specific membership numbers are not disclosed in the document.**
