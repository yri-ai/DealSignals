To find the total lease obligations, I need to look through the document for information about WeWork's future lease payment obligations.

From the document, I can find this key information:

"As of June 30, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was $36.6 billion and committed sales contracts to be recognized as revenue in the future totaled approximately $3 billion."

**Answer: As of June 30, 2021, WeWork's total future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was $36.6 billion.**

Additional context from the document:
- The Company had negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners, resulting in approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments since December 31, 2019
- Total security packages (including corporate guarantees, letters of credit, cash security deposits, and surety bonds) provided by the Company in respect of those lease obligations was approximately $6.5 billion, representing less than 20% of future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations
- The average length of the initial term of WeWork's leases is approximately 15 years
