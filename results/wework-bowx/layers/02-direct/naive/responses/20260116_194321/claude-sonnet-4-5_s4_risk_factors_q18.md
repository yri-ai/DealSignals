To calculate the implied enterprise value from this document, I need to identify the relevant information:

**Equity Value:**
- The document states a **pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion** (see "Aggregate Merger Consideration" section)

**Net Debt Components:**

Looking at the June 30, 2021 consolidated balance sheet data:
- Cash and cash equivalents: $1,397,610 thousand (from current assets)
- The document mentions various debt facilities with SoftBank:
  - 2020 LC Facility: $1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit
  - SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt: $2.2 billion outstanding
  - SoftBank Senior Secured Debt: up to $1.1 billion available (but unclear how much is drawn)

**Implied Enterprise Value Calculation:**

Based on the information provided:
- Equity Value: ~$6.553 billion
- Add: Net Debt (appears to be approximately $3.9 billion based on the LC Facility + Senior Unsecured Debt)

**Implied Enterprise Value ≈ $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion**

The document actually confirms this calculation in the "BowX's Board of Directors' Reasons for the Business Combination" section, which states:
- **"Attractive Initial Valuation. WeWork will have an anticipated initial pre-transaction enterprise value of $8.8 billion."**

**Answer: The implied enterprise value is approximately $8.8 billion.**
