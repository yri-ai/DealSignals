The document does not describe a specific valuation methodology used to justify the transaction price. In fact, it explicitly states that:

**No Independent Valuation Opinion Was Obtained:**

From the Q&A section:
"Q: Did the board of directors of BowX obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business Combination?

A: **No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion** in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders."

**Key Valuation Information Provided:**

Instead of a formal valuation methodology, the document states:

1. **Pre-transaction equity value**: Approximately **$6.553 billion**
   - Based on 655,300,000 shares at a deemed value of $10.00 per share

2. **Enterprise value**: Approximately **$8.8 billion** (mentioned as "attractive initial valuation")

3. **PIPE Investment**: $800 million at $10.00 per share

The board's approval was based on their own judgment and the factors they considered (market opportunity, management team, business model, etc.) rather than a formal third-party fairness opinion or detailed valuation methodology.
