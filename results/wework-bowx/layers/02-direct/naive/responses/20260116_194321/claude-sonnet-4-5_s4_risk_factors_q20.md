According to the document, there are no comparable transactions or specific comparable companies cited. The document is primarily focused on the BowX-WeWork merger transaction itself and does not reference other comparable SPAC mergers, real estate transactions, or comparable companies as valuation references.

The board of directors explicitly states in the section "Did the board of directors of BowX obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business Combination?":

"No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders."

While the document discusses WeWork's competitive position in the flexible workspace market, it does not cite specific comparable companies or transactions for valuation purposes.
