Based on the document, Adam Neumann's ongoing relationship/exposure includes:

1. **Board Observer Rights**: Beginning February 26, 2022, Mr. Neumann (or his designee subject to SBG's approval) has the right to observe New WeWork board meetings and certain committee meetings in a non-voting capacity. He is entitled to receive copies of written materials provided to directors.

2. **Duration of Observer Rights**: These rights terminate when he ceases to beneficially own equity securities of WeWork representing at least 19,028,251 shares of WeWork Class A Common Stock (on an as-converted basis).

3. **Limitations**: 
   - He can only attend in a non-voting observer capacity
   - He has no right to participate in director conversations outside formal meetings
   - He has no right to influence board decisions or actions
   - New WeWork can withhold information if it would adversely affect attorney-client privilege, involve trade secrets, create conflicts of interest, or if he violates his restrictive covenant obligations

4. **Confidentiality**: He must hold all information provided under this agreement in confidence.

5. **Related Party Transactions**: The document notes that WeWork has historically entered into transactions with landlord entities in which Adam Neumann had ownership interests, and these are being addressed as part of the Company's restructuring.

6. **Indemnification**: The Company has agreed to indemnify certain former directors and officers (including Neumann) and has already paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications in 2020.
