Based on the risk factors section, the top disclosed risk factors for WeWork are:

1. **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic had a significant impact on the Company's business, with memberships declining 16% between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, and causing increased member churn and non-payment.

2. **Member Retention**: The Company may not be able to continue to retain existing members or attract new members. Many members can terminate with as little as one month notice, with approximately 10% of physical memberships being month-to-month during the six months ended June 30, 2021.

3. **Lease Obligations**: The Company has long-term lease obligations ($36.6 billion in future undiscounted minimum lease payment obligations as of June 30, 2021) while member agreements are much shorter-term (average 15 months vs 15-year leases).

4. **History of Losses**: The Company has an accumulated deficit and recorded net losses of $3.0 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion, and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively.

5. **Transformation Uncertainty**: The Company is undergoing a business transformation under new management with no assurance the new strategy will be successful.

6. **Brand and Reputation**: The Company's success depends heavily on maintaining its brand value and reputation, which has been challenged by negative publicity.

7. **Workforce Management**: The Company has reduced its global workforce by approximately 70% and may face challenges in managing employee turnover and retention.

8. **Economic Downturns**: Economic downturns could lead to increased member terminations, particularly among small- and mid-sized businesses that comprise a significant portion of the member base.
