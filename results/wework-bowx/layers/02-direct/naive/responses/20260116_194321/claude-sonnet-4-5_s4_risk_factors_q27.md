Step 1: Identify relevant information about litigation and disputes

Looking through the document, I need to find information about legal proceedings, litigation, or disputes that are material to the company's operations.

Step 2: Locate key sections

The document mentions several areas where litigation or disputes exist or could exist:

1. Landlord disputes related to lease amendments and rent payments
2. Regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork's 2019 withdrawn IPO
3. Small number of landlords who have sued to enforce corporate guarantees
4. Employment-related litigation risks

Step 3: Extract specific details

From the document:

- "In a small number of cases, the Company's real estate portfolio optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords. As the process continues, additional litigation could result..."

- The document mentions "significant legal costs incurred by WeWork in connection with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork's 2019 withdrawn initial public offering and the related execution of the SoftBank Transactions"

- "In 2020, [the Company] paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications"

- "A small number of landlords have sued to enforce the corporate guarantees"

- At certain locations, "the Company has withheld, is withholding, or may in the future withhold rent payments" which "In a small number of cases...have resulted in litigation filed by landlords"

Answer: Yes, there are material litigation and disputes. According to the document, WeWork faces several types of material litigation:

1. **Landlord Litigation**: A small number of landlords have sued to enforce corporate guarantees, and the Company's real estate portfolio optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords in some cases. The document indicates additional litigation could result as the optimization process continues.

2. **2019 IPO-Related Matters**: The Company incurred significant legal costs in connection with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork's 2019 withdrawn initial public offering and the related SoftBank Transactions.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: In 2020, the Company paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to indemnifications for certain current and former directors, executive officers, and shareholders, and may be required to pay more in the future.

4. **Potential Future Disputes**: The Company acknowledges it "could be exposed to breach of contract, eviction or other claims that could result in direct and indirect costs" as it continues its lease optimization efforts, including situations where it has withheld or may withhold rent payments.
