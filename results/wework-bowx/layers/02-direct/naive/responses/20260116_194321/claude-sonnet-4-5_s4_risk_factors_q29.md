I cannot find any auditor statements or opinions explicitly included in this document. While the document refers to audited financial statements multiple times throughout (such as in the financial data sections), the actual auditor's reports or opinions are not reproduced in the portions of the S-4/A filing that were provided.

The document does mention in the "EXPERTS" section (referenced but not shown in full detail) that KPMG LLP audited WeWork's financial statements, but the specific auditor's report and opinions are not included in the provided text.

To find what the auditors said, you would need to:
1. Look at the complete audited financial statements included elsewhere in the proxy statement/prospectus
2. Review the auditor's report section that would typically precede the financial statements
3. Check the "EXPERTS" section for more detailed information about the auditor's opinions

The document does note that "Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the transactions described in this proxy statement/prospectus," but this is separate from the independent auditor's opinion on the financial statements.
