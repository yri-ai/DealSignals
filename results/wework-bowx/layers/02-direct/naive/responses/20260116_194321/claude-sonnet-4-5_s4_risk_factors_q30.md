Based on the provided document, there are indications of internal control concerns, though no specific "material weaknesses" are explicitly declared in the traditional financial reporting sense.

The document does contain this relevant statement:

"WeWork's internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company and a company of its global scale."

This statement is listed as a risk factor, indicating that WeWork acknowledges its internal controls, financial systems, and procedures require additional development to meet the standards expected of a public company and a company of its size and complexity.

However, the document does not explicitly use the term "material weakness" in the formal sense that would typically appear in a management assessment of internal controls over financial reporting or an auditor's opinion. The statement suggests deficiencies exist but doesn't provide the detailed assessment that would typically accompany a formal declaration of material weaknesses.

This is significant because companies undergoing business combinations and becoming publicly traded entities are required to have robust internal controls that meet the standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the acknowledgment that "further development" is needed suggests there may be control deficiencies that need to be addressed.
