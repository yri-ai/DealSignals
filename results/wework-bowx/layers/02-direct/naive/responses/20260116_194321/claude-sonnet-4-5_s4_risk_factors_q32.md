Looking at the document, the voting structure post-merger includes the following key elements:

**Stock Classes:**
- **Class A Common Stock**: Standard voting shares with economic rights (dividends, liquidation proceeds)
- **Class C Common Stock**: Non-economic voting security without rights to dividends or liquidation proceeds. These shares correspond to WeWork Partnerships Profits Interest Units and are paired 1:1 with Class A Common Stock held by the partnership.

**Voting Rights:**
- Both Class A and Class C Common Stock appear to have one vote per share
- Class A and Class B Common Stock holders vote together as a single class on most matters

**Key Voting Restrictions:**
The most significant feature is a **SoftBank voting cap** (Organizational Documents Proposal B):

"With respect to any vote or election submitted to the holders of shares of New WeWork Capital Stock for approval, to restrict the SoftBank Holders (as defined herein), for a period of at least two years, from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present (attending virtually or by proxy) and voting at any such meeting of the stockholders."

**Share Authorization:**
- 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
- 25,041,666 shares of Class C Common Stock  
- 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock

This structure gives SoftBank significant influence (as a major shareholder) while limiting their voting control to under 50% at any stockholder meeting for at least two years post-merger.
