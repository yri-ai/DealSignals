Based on the document provided, comparable transactions were not disclosed. The document focuses on the BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork Inc. merger transaction details, including:

1. The specific terms of this transaction (the Merger Agreement)
2. Related agreements such as PIPE investments, subscription agreements, and various support agreements
3. Financial information specific to BowX and WeWork
4. The structure and mechanics of the proposed merger

However, there is **no discussion or analysis of comparable M&A transactions** that would typically include:
- Other similar SPAC mergers
- Comparable valuations of similar companies
- Market multiples from comparable transactions
- Precedent transaction analysis

The document does note on page 23 that **"BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider"** and states:

> "BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider, and consequently, you have no assurance from an independent source that the Business Combination is fair to BowX from a financial point of view."

This indicates that no formal fairness opinion was obtained, which would typically include comparable transaction analysis. The Board of Directors evaluated the transaction based on their own judgment of the business merits rather than through a formal valuation process that would include comparable transactions.
