Based on the provided document, the exit/refinancing strategy for the lease obligations includes the following key elements:

### Lease Optimization and Exit Strategy

**Portfolio Optimization Efforts:**
- Beginning in fall 2019, WeWork began a global review of locations to optimize its real estate portfolio
- As of June 30, 2021, WeWork and its joint venture partners have negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners
- This resulted in approximately **$6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments** and a reduction in total lease security of approximately **$1.1 billion** (including ChinaCo prior to deconsolidation) since December 31, 2019

**Execution Approach:**
The document states: "This has resulted in strategically executing full or partial lease exits for locations with more limited prospects of profitability."

**Lease Termination Terms:**
- During 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, WeWork "incurred lease-related termination costs in connection with the aforementioned strategic lease terminations, **substantially all being equal to or less than the security coverage of each lease**"
- WeWork "anticipates that there will be additional lease termination fees paid in the future, substantially all of which are expected to be equal to or less than the security coverage of each applicable lease"

**Challenges:**
- At certain locations, WeWork "has not been able to, and may not be able to, reduce its rent under the lease or otherwise terminate the lease"
- The Company has withheld or may withhold rent payments at certain locations during optimization efforts
- Some landlords have filed litigation as a result of these efforts

The strategy appears to focus on negotiating exits primarily within the bounds of existing security deposits and guarantees, rather than seeking external refinancing solutions.
