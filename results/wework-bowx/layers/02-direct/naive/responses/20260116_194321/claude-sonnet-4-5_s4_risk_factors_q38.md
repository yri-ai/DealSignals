Based on the document, several post-merger integration and business model changes were planned:

## Organizational Structure Changes

1. **Change of Corporate Name**: BowX Acquisition Corp. would change its name to "WeWork Inc." upon closing of the merger.

2. **New Board of Directors**: The board would be reconstituted with nine directors upon closing, including executives from both organizations.

3. **Management Structure**: New WeWork would have a defined executive officer structure with specific roles including:
   - Sandeep Mathrani as CEO
   - Additional executives in roles such as COO, CFO, General Counsel, and others

## Capital Structure Changes

1. **Stock Structure**: Implementation of a new capital structure with:
   - Class A Common Stock (voting and economic rights)
   - Class C Common Stock (voting only, non-economic)
   - Authorized preferred stock

2. **Equity Compensation Plans**: Adoption of:
   - 2021 Equity Incentive Plan
   - 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

## Business Model Transformation

The document indicates WeWork was already undergoing business transformation under new management prior to the merger:

1. **Focus on Profitability**: "The Company's new strategic plan emphasizes achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations"

2. **Portfolio Optimization**: Focusing on "optimizing the Company's existing real estate portfolio of domestic and international locations and executing well on its current pipeline of locations before seeking growth opportunities"

3. **Lease Restructuring**: As of June 30, 2021, the Company had "negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners around the world, resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments"

4. **Alternative Business Models**: Pursuing "asset-light arrangements such as management agreements, regional joint ventures and other occupancy arrangements with real estate owners"

5. **Platform Development**: "WeWork is currently developing a platform that would leverage its systems and established global customer base to offer landlords and operators the ability to power and manage flexible spaces in their portfolio"

## Governance Changes

1. **Voting Restrictions**: Implementation of voting restrictions limiting SoftBank Holders to exercising voting rights over no more than 49.9% of voting securities for at least two years

2. **Stockholders Agreement**: New governance arrangements including board designation rights for certain major shareholders

The merger appears designed primarily to provide public listing and capital infusion while continuing WeWork's existing transformation efforts rather than implementing entirely new strategic changes.
