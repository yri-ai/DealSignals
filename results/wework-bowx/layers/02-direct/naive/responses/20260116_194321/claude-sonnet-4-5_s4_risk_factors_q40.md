Based on the extensive information in this S-4/A filing, I would **not invest** in this business combination. Here are the key concerns:

## Critical Red Flags:

### 1. **Massive Historical Losses**
- Accumulated deficit at June 30, 2021
- Net losses: $3.0B (H1 2021), $3.8B (2020), $3.8B (2019), $1.9B (2018)
- No clear path to GAAP profitability demonstrated

### 2. **Fundamental Business Model Issues**
- **Severe lease/revenue mismatch**: Average 15-year lease terms vs. 15-month membership agreements
- As of June 30, 2021: $36.6B in future lease obligations vs. only $3B in committed future revenue
- Only ~20% of lease obligations secured ($6.5B security packages)
- Members can terminate with just 1 month notice in many cases

### 3. **COVID-19 Impact**
- 16% membership decline (Q2 2020 to Q2 2021)
- Significant bad debt increases
- Business model vulnerability to pandemics/remote work trends exposed

### 4. **Governance and Related Party Concerns**
- History of related party transactions
- Adam Neumann (former CEO associated with 2019 IPO failure) retains board observer rights
- SoftBank as major creditor and equity holder creates potential conflicts
- $2.2B outstanding to SoftBank, plus $1.7B in letters of credit

### 5. **Valuation Concerns**
- $6.6B pre-transaction equity value despite negative equity of $(9.96)B at June 30, 2021
- No independent fairness opinion obtained
- Shareholders' deficit worsening: $(4.7)B (2019) → $(7.7)B (2020) → $(10.0)B (June 2021)

### 6. **Operational Risks**
- 70% workforce reduction since 2019
- Ongoing lease restructuring/exits (500+ negotiated)
- Litigation risks from landlords
- Integration risks from management changes

### 7. **Market Saturation Risk**
- Already 763 locations globally
- Limited growth strategy going forward
- Moderating expansion plans

## The Only Potential Positive:
- New management's strategic restructuring efforts showing some progress
- Lease obligation reductions of $6.9B achieved

## Conclusion:
This represents a highly speculative investment in a business with:
- Unproven ability to achieve profitability
- Structural business model flaws (lease/revenue duration mismatch)
- Massive debt obligations
- Vulnerability to economic downturns and remote work trends

The SPAC structure adds another layer of concern, as these vehicles historically underperform. The lack of an independent fairness opinion is particularly troubling for a transaction of this magnitude.

**Recommendation: Avoid this investment.** The risk/reward profile is highly unfavorable for public market investors.
