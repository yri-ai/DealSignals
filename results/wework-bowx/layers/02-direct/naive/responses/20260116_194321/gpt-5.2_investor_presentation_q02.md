The document excerpt provided does not include any revenue figures by year (or a table/chart with revenues), so the year-over-year revenue growth rate cannot be calculated from the available information.

If you share revenues for two consecutive years (e.g., Revenue 2020 and Revenue 2021), I can compute it as:

\[
\text{YoY Revenue Growth} = \frac{\text{Revenue}_{t} - \text{Revenue}_{t-1}}{\text{Revenue}_{t-1}}
\]
