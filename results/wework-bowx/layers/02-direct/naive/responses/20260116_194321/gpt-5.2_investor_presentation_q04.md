The document excerpt provided does not include any financial figures (cash balance, operating cash flow, free cash flow, or net cash used in operations) from which a cash burn rate can be calculated, so the cash burn rate **cannot be determined from this document**.

If you share the period’s cash used (e.g., “net cash used in operating activities” or “free cash flow”) and the time period (monthly/quarterly), I can compute the burn rate (e.g., cash used ÷ months in period).
