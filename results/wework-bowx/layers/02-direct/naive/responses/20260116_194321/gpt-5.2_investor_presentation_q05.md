The document excerpt provided does **not include the figures needed to calculate cash runway** (i.e., current cash balance and the current cash burn rate/negative free cash flow). Therefore, the **cash runway at the current burn rate cannot be determined from this document**.

To answer it, we would need:
- **Cash on hand** (or liquidity available), and  
- **Current burn rate** (e.g., average monthly net cash outflow)

Then: **Cash runway (months) = Cash on hand ÷ Monthly burn rate**.
