The document’s stated **path to profitability** is driven by **WeWork All Access**—an on‑demand/pay‑as‑you‑go or subscription offering that:

- **Generates partnerships** (affinity partnerships to drive top‑of‑funnel demand)  
- **Drives occupancy** (pushes occupancy beyond physical capacity across the portfolio using utilization projections)  
- **Delivers high margins** (significant incremental margins from the subscription model layered on top of the traditional leased business)

**Timeline:** The slide shows a long‑range timeline marked **2010 through 2030** (in two‑year increments), indicating the profitability ramp is framed across that **2010–2030 horizon** rather than giving a single specific year in the excerpt provided.
