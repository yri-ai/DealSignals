The provided excerpt is heavily redacted/placeholdered (mostly “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with bullet points but no readable content). As a result, the document **does not disclose the specific “key assumptions underlying the projections.”**  

The only clearly legible assumption-like items relate to **All Access** and imply the projections may assume:
- **Adoption of an on-demand/subscription model** (“pay‑as‑you‑go or monthly subscription” with access to a global network)
- **Incremental demand generation via affinity/partnership channels** (“generates partnerships…top of funnel demand”)
- **Improved occupancy/utilization management** (“drive occupancy beyond physical capacity…based on utilization projections”)
- **High incremental margins from subscription revenue** layered on top of the traditional leased model (“significant incremental margins”)

If you can share the pages/sections where the projection assumptions are listed (or a less-redacted version), I can extract and summarize the full set precisely (e.g., occupancy, pricing, churn, lease costs, expansion cadence, etc.).
