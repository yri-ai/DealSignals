**Occupancy rate** is the percentage of WeWork’s available workspace capacity that is occupied (i.e., sold/used) at a given time—typically calculated as **occupied capacity ÷ total available capacity**.

**Trend:** The provided document pages do not include any readable numeric occupancy-rate data or a visible chart/table showing its change over time (most content is redacted/blank aside from general statements like “Drives Occupancy”). As a result, **the trend cannot be determined from this document excerpt**.
