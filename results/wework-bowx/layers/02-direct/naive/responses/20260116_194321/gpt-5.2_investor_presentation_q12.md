The document excerpt provided does **not include the figures needed to calculate or state “average revenue per member.”** It appears heavily redacted/omitted (mostly confidentiality headers and bullets), and no member count or revenue totals tied to “per member” are visible.

If you can share the page/section that shows **total revenue and total members** (or a table/KPI explicitly labeled “Average revenue per member”), I can compute it. Typically:

**Average revenue per member = Total revenue ÷ Average (or ending) number of members**
