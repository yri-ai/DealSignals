The provided document excerpt does **not include any readable data or chart** showing the **lease commitments by maturity (duration profile)**—it’s largely redacted/blank in the relevant sections. 

So, **the duration profile of lease commitments cannot be determined from the information shown**. If you can share the specific slide/table that lists lease payments by year (e.g., “<1 year, 1–3, 3–5, 5+” or a maturity ladder), I can summarize the duration profile precisely.
