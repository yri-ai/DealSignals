The provided document excerpt does not include any readable content describing **lease termination provisions** (it appears to be mostly confidentiality footers and high-level marketing/culture slides, with the relevant contractual/lease terms not shown).  

If you can share the specific page/section that covers leases (or upload a clearer image of the lease/accounting/commitments slide), I can extract and summarize the termination provisions exactly as stated.
