The provided document excerpt does not include any readable content describing **SoftBank’s role** or its **ongoing obligations** (it mostly contains “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” placeholders and partial, non-specific bullets). As a result, **SoftBank’s role and obligations cannot be determined from this document**.

If you can share the specific slide/page that mentions SoftBank (or a clearer export), I can extract and summarize its role and any continuing commitments (e.g., funding backstops, guarantees, governance/board rights, lockups, service agreements).
