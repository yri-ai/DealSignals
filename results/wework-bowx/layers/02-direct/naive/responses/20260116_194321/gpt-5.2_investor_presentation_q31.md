The provided document excerpt does not include any readable information about **board composition post‑merger** (the pages shown are largely redacted/blank aside from general company values and an “All Access” description). As a result, the **post‑merger board composition cannot be determined from this document**.

If you can share the specific slide/page that lists governance or “Board of Directors” details (often in a transaction overview section), I can extract the exact composition.
