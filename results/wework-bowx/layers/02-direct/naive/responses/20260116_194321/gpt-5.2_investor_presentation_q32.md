The provided document excerpt does **not include any information about the post‑merger voting structure** (e.g., share classes, vote-per-share, founder/sponsor control, or any dual-class arrangements). It appears to be heavily redacted/partial and contains no governance or capitalization table details.

If you can share the slide/page that covers **“Capitalization,” “Governance,” “Share Classes,”** or **“Voting Rights post‑merger,”** I can extract the exact voting structure.
