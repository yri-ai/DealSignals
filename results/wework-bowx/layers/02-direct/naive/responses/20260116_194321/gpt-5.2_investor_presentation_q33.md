The provided document excerpt does not include any readable section describing **lock-up agreements** (e.g., duration, who is subject to lock-up, share quantities, or release schedule). Most of the pages shown are redacted/blank aside from general company values and an “All Access” business description.

If you can share the specific page/slide that mentions **“Lock-up”** (or paste the relevant text), I can summarize exactly what the lock-up agreements are.
