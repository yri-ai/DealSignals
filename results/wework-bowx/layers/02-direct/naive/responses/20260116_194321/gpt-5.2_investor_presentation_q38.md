The document indicates a planned **business model shift/expansion** (rather than detailing a step-by-step post‑merger integration plan):

- **Launch/scale “All Access”**: an **on‑demand pay‑as‑you‑go or monthly subscription** product providing access to WeWork’s global network of locations.  
- **Use partnerships to drive demand**: **affinity partnerships** were intended to **generate top‑of‑funnel demand**.  
- **Operate beyond physical capacity using utilization management**: All Access was expected to **drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels** across the portfolio based on **utilization projections**.  
- **Improve incremental margins via subscription overlay**: the subscription model was positioned as **high margin**, delivering **significant incremental margins** on top of the traditional leased-space business.

No explicit post‑merger integration workstreams (systems, org, governance, etc.) are described in the provided text beyond these business model changes.
