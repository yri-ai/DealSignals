The document does **not** state a single “cash burn rate” figure.

However, it provides enough information to infer **operating cash burn** from WeWork’s cash flow statement:

- **Net cash used in operating activities (WeWork)** for the **six months ended June 30, 2021**: **$(1,158,957) million**.

Implied average **operating cash burn rate**:
- **Monthly:** $(1,158.957B / 6) ≈ **$193.2 million per month**
- **Daily (approx., 181 days in H1 2021):** $(1,158.957B / 181) ≈ **$6.4 million per day**

Note: This is **operating cash burn only** (excludes investing capex and financing flows). If you want a “free cash flow burn rate,” the document reports **Free Cash Flow** of **$(1,312,099) million** for the same six-month period (≈ **$218.7 million/month**).
