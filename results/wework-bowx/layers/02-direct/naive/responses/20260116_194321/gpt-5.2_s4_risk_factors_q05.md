The document does **not** provide enough information to calculate a reliable “cash runway at current burn rate” for New WeWork.

What it *does* provide:
- **WeWork net cash used in operating activities (6 months ended June 30, 2021):** **$1.159B**.  
  - Implied operating cash burn rate ≈ **$193M/month** ($1.159B ÷ 6).
- **WeWork Free Cash Flow (6 months ended June 30, 2021):** **($1.312B)** (operating cash flow minus capex).  
  - Implied FCF burn rate ≈ **$219M/month** ($1.312B ÷ 6).
- **Liquidity/cash balance** (cash and cash equivalents) is **not shown** in the excerpt you provided (it only shows *total current assets*, not cash), and post-close cash depends on:
  - **BowX trust cash remaining after redemptions** (trust was ~$483M as of 6/30/2021, but redemptions could materially reduce this), plus
  - **$800M PIPE**, less
  - **transaction fees/expenses**, and other uses.

So:
- If you define burn as **operating cash burn**, the **current burn rate** implied by the filing is about **$193M/month**.
- If you define burn as **Free Cash Flow burn**, it’s about **$219M/month**.
- But **runway (months) = available cash ÷ monthly burn** cannot be computed from this excerpt because **available cash at close / cash on hand isn’t provided** here.

If you share the **cash and cash equivalents** figure (or the “sources and uses” table / pro forma cash) from the filing, I can compute runway under both burn definitions and under different redemption scenarios.
