The excerpt provided **does not state a specific “path to profitability” or a concrete timeline to achieve profitability** for WeWork/New WeWork.

What it does say, at a high level, is that **management’s strategic plan emphasizes “achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations,”** alongside **optimizing the existing real estate portfolio** (including lease amendments/exits) and **executing on the current pipeline before pursuing new growth opportunities**. However, it explicitly notes **“there is no assurance”** the plan will be successful and provides **no date/period target** (e.g., year/quarter) for profitability.
