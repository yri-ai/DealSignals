The excerpt provided does **not** include a standalone set of management “projections” (i.e., forecast financial statements) or a section explicitly listing the **assumptions underlying projections**.

What it *does* include are several **assumptions used for illustrative pro forma ownership/per‑share data and related transaction modeling**, which are effectively the key stated assumptions underlying the document’s forward-looking illustrative figures:

- **Exchange ratio / equity value assumption**
  - Aggregate Merger Consideration fixed at **655,300,000 shares** of New WeWork Class A at a deemed value of **$10.00/share** (implying **~$6.553B** pre-transaction equity value).
  - **Exchange Ratio expected ~0.8257** (based on capitalization as of **Sept. 14, 2021**), subject to adjustment.

- **PIPE financing assumption**
  - Assumes a **$800 million PIPE**: **80,000,000 shares** at **$10.00/share** purchased at closing.

- **Redemption assumptions (two modeled scenarios)**
  - **No Redemption** scenario: assumes **0** public shares redeemed.
  - **Maximum Redemption** scenario: assumes **43,231,098** public shares redeemed (aggregate redemption payments **$432.3M**).

- **Minimum cash / closing condition assumption**
  - Assumes the transaction satisfies the **Minimum Available Cash Condition**: **Trust Amount + PIPE ≥ $800.0M** (PIPE alone expected to satisfy it in the maximum redemption case).

- **Equity/convertible instrument treatment assumptions used in ownership/dilution tables**
  - Assumes vesting/settlement/exercise for certain “in-the-money” instruments (as stated in the ownership table notes), including:
    - vesting of restricted stock awards,
    - vesting/exercise of in-the-money options,
    - vesting/issuance of RSUs,
    - vesting/net exercise of in-the-money warrants,
    - issuance of shares as merger consideration per the agreement.
  - Out-of-the-money options and warrants are **excluded** from Aggregate Merger Consideration calculations.

If you mean **operating/financial projections for WeWork/New WeWork** (revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, etc.), please share the section of the filing where those projections appear (often in a “Certain Forecasts/Projections” or “Background of the Business Combination” section), and I can extract the specific assumption list.
