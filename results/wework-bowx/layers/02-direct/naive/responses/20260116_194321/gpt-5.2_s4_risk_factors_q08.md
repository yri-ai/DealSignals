The excerpt you provided **does not define or disclose “contribution margin per membership”** or provide the underlying inputs (e.g., contribution profit and membership count over the same period) needed to calculate it.

So, **based on this document alone, contribution margin per membership cannot be determined**.

(For clarity, in general usage this metric is typically calculated as **contribution margin ÷ number of memberships** over the relevant period, but the document doesn’t give contribution margin.)
