**Revenue per available desk/workstation** is a unit economics metric calculated as:

\[
\textbf{Revenue per available desk (or workstation)} = \frac{\textbf{Total membership and service revenue for the period}}{\textbf{Average number of available desks/workstations in the period}}
\]

- **“Revenue”** typically refers to *membership and service revenue* (the core revenue stream tied to desks/workstations).
- **“Available desks/workstations”** means the total desk/workstation capacity that is open and available for sale/use (not just occupied), usually averaged over the period.
