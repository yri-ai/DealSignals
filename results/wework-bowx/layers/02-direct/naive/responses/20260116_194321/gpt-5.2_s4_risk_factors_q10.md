**Occupancy rate (as used by WeWork in this document)** is referenced as **“Physical Occupancy,”** which the proxy statement defines as:

- **Physical Occupancy = (number of physical memberships) ÷ (total workstations)**

**Trend (per the disclosed data in this document):**
- The filing **does not provide a time series of physical occupancy percentages** in the excerpted sections you provided.
- It does, however, give an **indicator of weaker utilization/demand during COVID** via membership counts: **total memberships declined 16% from the quarter ended June 30, 2020 to the quarter ended June 30, 2021**, which suggests occupancy likely faced pressure over that period (all else equal), but **an exact occupancy-rate trend is not explicitly stated** here.
