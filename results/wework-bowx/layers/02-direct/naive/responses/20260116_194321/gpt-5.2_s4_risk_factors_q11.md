The document does **not** provide a specific definition or numerical **member churn rate**.

It does note membership decline and contract termination characteristics (e.g., total memberships declined **16%** from the quarter ended June 30, 2020 to the quarter ended June 30, 2021; ~**10%** of physical memberships were month‑to‑month commitments during the six months ended June 30, 2021), but it does **not** define “member churn rate” as a KPI or give a churn-rate formula/value.
