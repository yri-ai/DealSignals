The document provided does **not** disclose the data needed to compute an “average revenue per member” (e.g., total members for the same period as revenue).

- It **does** disclose **revenue** (e.g., **$1,191,331 thousand** for the six months ended June 30, 2021).
- But it does **not** provide the corresponding **member count** for that period (only some qualitative/percentage information such as memberships declining 16%, and that Enterprise Members account for a certain % of revenue).

**Therefore, the average revenue per member cannot be determined from this document excerpt.**
