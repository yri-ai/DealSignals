WeWork’s lease commitments are **long-dated and front-loaded by long initial terms**:

- **Average initial lease term:** approximately **15 years**.  
- **Limited termination flexibility:** leases are generally **long-term** and, **with limited exceptions, do not contain early termination provisions**.  
- **Scale of remaining commitments (as of June 30, 2021):** **$36.6 billion** of **future undiscounted minimum lease payments** under signed operating and finance leases.

So the lease commitment “duration profile” is characterized by **multi-year (≈15-year) obligations with limited early exit**, leaving WeWork exposed to long fixed costs versus much shorter member contract terms.
