The document explains that **WeWork’s leases generally do not provide early termination rights**:

- WeWork’s locations are “**primarily entered into by and through special purpose entity subsidiaries**.”
- The leases are “**primarily entered into by and through [subsidiaries] under long-term leases that, with limited exceptions, do not contain early termination provisions**.”
- As a result, “**at certain locations, [WeWork] has not been able to, and may not be able to, reduce its rent under the lease or otherwise terminate the lease**,” except by **negotiating lease amendments/exits, assigning the lease, or subleasing** (often subject to landlord notice/consent restrictions).

So, **lease termination is generally not available contractually** (except limited exceptions) and typically must be achieved via **negotiated exits/amendments or transfers (assignment/sublease)**.
