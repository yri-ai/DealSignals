At roughly **70% occupancy**, the business (WeWork/New WeWork) is generally **not expected to be profitable on a location basis** because its cost structure is dominated by **fixed, long-term lease payments** that do **not flex down** with occupancy.

From the document’s risk-factor discussion:
- WeWork’s leases typically have **fixed monthly/quarterly payments** with **minimum rent obligations**, largely **not tied to utilization**.
- If a location **does not generate sufficient revenue from members** (i.e., occupancy is too low), **lease cost expense exceeds revenue**, hurting cash flow and results of operations.
- Because lease terms are long (average initial term ~**15 years**) while memberships are shorter (average ~**15 months**, and some can be cancelled with **one month’s notice**), sustained sub-100% occupancy can quickly translate into **operating losses** that are hard to eliminate without renegotiating/exiting leases or subleasing.

So, **at 70% occupancy**, many sites would likely be **cash-flow negative**, forcing reliance on:
- continued sales/marketing to refill space,
- pricing concessions (which can further compress margins),
- and/or lease restructuring/exits (which can involve costs and litigation risk).
