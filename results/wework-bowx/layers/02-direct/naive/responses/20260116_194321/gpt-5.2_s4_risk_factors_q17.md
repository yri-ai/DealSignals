At **~50% occupancy**, WeWork’s locations typically **do not cover their largely fixed lease and operating costs**, so the business tends to **generate losses and consume cash**. This is because:

- **Lease payments are long-term and mostly fixed** (generally not tied to utilization), while **member revenue is shorter-term and can decline quickly** as members churn.
- If revenue per location falls such that **lease cost expense exceeds membership and service revenue**, WeWork may need to:
  - **Increase discounting/marketing** to refill space (hurting margins), and/or
  - **Renegotiate, sublease, or exit leases** (often with costs and potential disruption/relocation churn), and/or
  - Take **impairment charges** if projected cash flows drop.

So, at **50% occupancy**, the document implies the business would likely be **under water at many sites** and would need continued restructuring (lease exits/amendments) or additional capital to sustain operations.
