The document does **not** use a market-based valuation (e.g., comparable companies or discounted cash flow) to justify the $10.00/share price.

Instead, for **registration fee/“proposed maximum aggregate offering price”** purposes, it states the valuation is **estimated as one-third of the aggregate par value of the WeWork securities expected to be exchanged in the merger** (per Rule 457(f)(2)), because WeWork is private, has no public market, and has an accumulated deficit.
