### Track record (what the document supports)

- The document characterizes WeWork’s leadership under **Marcelo Claure and Sandeep Mathrani** as having **“decades of public market experience”** and states they have **“demonstrated proven results within their first 12 months at WeWork,”** including refocusing on the core business model and applying a disciplined approach to costs.
- It does **not** provide detailed prior-company histories, quantified performance metrics attributable specifically to these individuals, or a resume-style track record beyond those qualitative statements.
- It does provide a **transaction-related compensation signal** for some executives (e.g., Mathrani transaction bonus; bonuses for other executives), but this is not evidence of operating performance—just contractual arrangements tied to the deal.

If you want, I can extract the exact quoted language around “proven results” and summarize it alongside any concrete operational metrics elsewhere in the filing (e.g., cost actions, lease exits, Adjusted EBITDA trends) that management highlights as outcomes of their tenure.
