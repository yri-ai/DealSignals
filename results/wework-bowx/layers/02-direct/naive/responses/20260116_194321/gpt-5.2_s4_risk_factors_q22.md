SoftBank (through SoftBank Group Corp. and affiliated entities, including SB WW Holdings (Cayman) Limited (“SBWW”) and SVF Endurance (Cayman) Limited (“SVFE”)) plays multiple roles in the transaction and has several **ongoing** governance and credit-support related obligations:

## 1) Major WeWork stockholder supporting the deal
- Certain WeWork stockholders, including SoftBank affiliates, entered into **Stockholder Support Agreements** to **approve the Merger Agreement/Business Combination via written consent**.
- **SBWW also has a consent right**: under SBWW’s Stockholder Support Agreement, **WeWork cannot amend or waive** certain Merger Agreement provisions **without SBWW’s prior written consent**, or SBWW’s obligations under that support agreement can terminate.

## 2) Governance influence after closing (but capped voting power)
- At closing, SoftBank affiliates are expected to become **significant stockholders** of “New WeWork.”
- A **Stockholders Agreement** to be entered at closing gives certain large holders (including SBWW and SVFE) **board nomination/designation rights** as long as they hold specified ownership levels.
- New WeWork’s charter includes a **voting cap**: for **at least two years**, the “SoftBank Holders” are **restricted from voting more than 49.9%** of the voting securities present and voting at a stockholder meeting (even if they own more).

## 3) Credit support / financing-related obligations
- SoftBank is also a key financing and credit-support counterparty to WeWork, including:
  - **Letter of Credit facility support**: A **Credit Support Letter Agreement** provides that the **SoftBank Obligor** commits to consent to extend the termination date of the **2020 LC Facility** from Feb. 10, 2023 to **no later than Feb. 10, 2024**, subject to terms (and lender consents are still required).
  - **Warrants as consideration for support**:
    - **First Warrant** issued to SBWW (or designees) at closing as an inducement to support certain preferred stock conversion mechanics.
    - **LC Warrant** issued to the SoftBank Obligor (or designees) **in consideration for agreeing to continue to act as co-obligor** for the LC facility extension period.
  - SoftBank (SBG) affiliates are also tied to a **Commitment Letter** relating to amended senior secured notes (up to $550 million).

In short, SoftBank is (i) a pivotal stockholder whose support/consent helps secure approval mechanics, (ii) a post-close governance participant (with nomination rights) whose voting power is temporarily capped, and (iii) a continuing credit-support/financing partner (LC facility extension support), compensated in part through warrants.
