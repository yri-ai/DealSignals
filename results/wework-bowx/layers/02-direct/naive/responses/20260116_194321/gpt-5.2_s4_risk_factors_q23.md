The document indicates WeWork has **multiple related‑party transactions**, primarily involving **SoftBank** and, historically, arrangements involving **Adam Neumann** and a former director’s affiliated real estate investment group. Key related‑party transactions/relationships described include:

- **SoftBank-related arrangements (majority of related-party activity)**
  - SoftBank is a significant stockholder and counterparty to various WeWork arrangements.
  - WeWork discloses that **all transactions with the “SoftBank Obligor” are related‑party transactions**, including debt/credit support arrangements.
  - As of **June 30, 2021**, WeWork had:
    - **$1.7 billion** of **outstanding letters of credit** issued under the **2020 LC Facility** (related party).
    - **$2.2 billion** of **outstanding indebtedness** under SoftBank senior unsecured debt (related party).
  - SoftBank/affiliates are also involved in **strategic investments/joint venture structures**, including:
    - The **PacificCo Roll-up** (WeWork Asia Holding Company B.V. becoming wholly owned after issuing Series H-1 Preferred Stock to SVFE).
    - A continuing **Japan joint venture** with funds affiliated with SVFE.
  - SoftBank equity-linked inducements connected to the Business Combination:
    - **First Warrant** to SBWW (SoftBank affiliate) as an inducement for preferred conversion support.
    - **LC Warrant** to SoftBank Obligor (or designee) tied to the LC facility term extension.

- **Historically related-party landlord / real estate transactions**
  - WeWork previously entered into lease/real estate transactions with **landlord entities** in which:
    - **Adam Neumann** (former CEO/director) had an ownership interest; and/or
    - **WeCap Investment Group** (operated with Rhône Group and associated with former director **Steven Langman**) had an ownership interest.
  - As part of restructuring, WeWork was in **ongoing discussions to exit certain related‑party leases**.

- **Indemnification-related payments to current/former insiders**
  - WeWork has indemnification obligations to certain current and former directors, officers and shareholders.
  - The document notes WeWork paid **~$14 million in legal fees in 2020** related to these indemnifications (outside insurance coverage).

- **Adam Neumann board observer right (post‑closing governance-related arrangement)**
  - Under an agreement, beginning **Feb. 26, 2022**, Neumann (or an approved designee) may have **board observer rights**, subject to conditions and confidentiality, until he falls below a specified ownership threshold.

- **Quantified related-party revenue/expense disclosure**
  - WeWork reports **related-party revenue** and **related-party expenses** in its financials (e.g., related‑party revenue of **$87.694M** for six months ended June 30, 2021; related‑party expenses of **$38.253M** for the same period), though the excerpt does not itemize the counterparties behind these totals.

If you want, I can organize the above into a concise table by counterparty (SoftBank / Neumann / other) and by type (financing, leases, governance, indemnification).
