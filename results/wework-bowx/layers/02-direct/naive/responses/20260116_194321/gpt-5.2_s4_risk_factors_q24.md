Management (both BowX and WeWork) had several deal-related incentives/compensation elements disclosed:

## BowX (SPAC) sponsor/director/officer incentives
BowX’s initial stockholders (including the Sponsor) and BowX directors/officers had strong economic incentives to close a transaction because their securities would become worthless if no business combination occurred by the deadline:
- **Founder shares:** initial stockholders owned **12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B common stock** (founder shares). They **waived redemption** rights on these shares, so they would be worth **$0 if no deal closes**.
- **Private placement warrants:** initial stockholders owned **7,773,333 private placement warrants** purchased for **$11.66 million**, which also **expire worthless if no business combination is completed**.
- **Sponsor support / forfeiture:** under the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Sponsor/Sponsor Persons agreed to **forfeit 3,000,000 shares of BowX Class B common stock** and to vote at least **9,454,534** Class B shares in favor of the deal.
- **Post-close role:** BowX’s chairman/co-CEO **Vivek Ranadivé** is expected to **continue as a director of New WeWork**, while other BowX officers/directors (except him) would resign at closing.
- **Other continuing benefits:** registration rights for sponsor holders (via a Registration Rights Agreement) and continuation of D&O indemnification/insurance post-close are also noted as interests.

## WeWork management compensation tied to the transaction (“transaction bonuses”)
WeWork disclosed explicit cash bonus payments triggered by a qualifying capital raise/public listing event—**the business combination satisfies this**:
- **CEO cash payment:** **Sandeep Mathrani** (WeWork CEO) entitled to **$10.0 million** at consummation, subject to **repayment (“clawback”)**:
  - repay **100% of after-tax amount** if he resigns without good reason or is terminated for cause **on/before Jan 31, 2022**
  - repay **50% of after-tax amount** if such termination occurs **after Jan 31, 2022 but on/before Jan 31, 2023**
- **Other executive officer bonus pool (target amounts):**
  - Anthony Yazbeck **$2.0M**
  - Ben Dunham **$1.5M**
  - Jared DeMatteis **$1.5M**
  - Lauren Fritts **$1.0M**
  - Peter Greenspan **$1.0M**
  - Hamid Hashemi **$0.75M**
  - Scott Morey **$0.30M**
  - Maral Kazanjian **$0.25M**
  - Roger Solé Rafols **$0.25M**
  - These are **target** amounts and may be adjusted up/down at Mathrani’s discretion, **subject to an aggregate cap of $11.5M**, and subject to the **same repayment obligations** as above.
- **Additional one-time bonus (COO promotion):** Anthony Yazbeck received a **GBP 1.44 million** one-time bonus payable within 30 days after closing, **conditional on employment through the payment date**.
- **Equity acceleration condition:** the transaction satisfies the **“liquidity event” vesting condition** for certain WeWork executive RSUs (service/performance vesting may still apply). As of July 15, 2021, executives held **4,347,818** such RSUs; **8,863** would be fully vested upon consummation, with the remainder still subject to additional vesting requirements.

If you want, I can separate these into “cash at close,” “equity/vesting impact,” and “governance/continuing role” and quantify the sponsor’s implied value at various post-close share prices.
