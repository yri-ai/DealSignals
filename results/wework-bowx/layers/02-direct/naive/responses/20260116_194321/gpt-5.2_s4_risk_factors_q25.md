Adam Neumann’s ongoing relationship/exposure is that **he has contractual “board observer” rights** in the post‑closing company (“New WeWork”).

- **When it starts:** Beginning **February 26, 2022**.  
- **What he (or his designee) gets:** The right to **observe meetings of New WeWork’s board (and certain committees) in a non‑voting observer capacity**, and to **receive copies of written materials** provided to directors, subject to conditions. He is **not a director** and has **no vote**.  
- **How long it lasts / termination trigger:** These observer rights terminate once he **ceases to beneficially own** WeWork equity (including profits interest units) representing at least **19,028,251 shares of WeWork Class A common stock (as‑converted, adjusted for splits/dividends)**.  
- **Confidentiality / limits:** He (or his designee) must keep information confidential, and New WeWork can **withhold information or exclude him** from portions of meetings to protect attorney‑client privilege, avoid disclosure of trade secrets, address conflicts, or if he violates restrictive covenants.
