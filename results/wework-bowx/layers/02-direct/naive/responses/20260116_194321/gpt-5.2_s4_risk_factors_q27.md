Yes. The document discloses **material litigation/disputes**, primarily in connection with WeWork’s real estate portfolio optimization and certain guarantees:

- **Landlord litigation tied to lease exits/renegotiations:** It states that, as part of WeWork’s efforts to amend or exit leases, **“in a small number of cases, [these] efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords,”** and warns that **additional litigation could result** as the process continues.

- **Guarantee enforcement disputes:** It also notes that **“a small number of landlords have sued to enforce the corporate guarantees”** related to certain leases.

- **Significant legal costs/reserves related to the 2019 withdrawn IPO and SoftBank transactions:** While not describing specific cases in this excerpt, the definitions and risk language indicate WeWork has incurred **significant legal costs** tied to **regulatory investigations and litigation** regarding the **2019 withdrawn IPO** and related SoftBank transactions.

These statements indicate the presence of litigation/disputes that could be material, even if the excerpt does not quantify all exposures or list each case.
