The excerpt you provided does **not** include an auditor’s report/opinion, so it does not state what the auditors said (e.g., unqualified opinion, going concern emphasis, etc.).

It only notes that:

- **BowX’s annual financial statements are audited** (“restated audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus”), while the interim June 30, 2021 financials are **unaudited**.  
- **WeWork’s financial statements are included elsewhere** in the document.

To answer “what did the auditors say,” I’d need the **auditor’s opinion section** from the financial statements (typically in the F-pages, e.g., “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”). If you paste that page, I can summarize the auditors’ conclusion precisely.
