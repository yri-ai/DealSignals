The provided excerpt does **not** identify or disclose any **material weaknesses** in internal control over financial reporting.

It does state, in the “Risk Factors” section, that **WeWork’s internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company and a company of its global scale**, but that is framed as a risk/need for improvement rather than an explicit finding of a material weakness.
