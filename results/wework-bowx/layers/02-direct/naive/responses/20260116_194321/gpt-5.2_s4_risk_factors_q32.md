Post‑merger (i.e., after BowX changes its name to **WeWork Inc. (“New WeWork”)**), the company will have a **dual‑class common stock voting structure**:

- **Class A common stock (New WeWork Class A)**: the primary economic equity (the document describes it as the common stock being issued as merger consideration and to PIPE investors; it will be NYSE‑listed under “WE”).
- **Class C common stock (New WeWork Class C)**: expressly described as a **“non‑economic voting security”**—it has **no rights to dividends or liquidation proceeds**, but provides voting power (issued in connection with certain WeWork partnership/profits interest arrangements).

In addition, for at least **two years**, the charter amendments include a **voting cap**: the **SoftBank holders’ voting rights are restricted to no more than 49.9%** of the voting securities **present and voting** at any stockholder meeting.
