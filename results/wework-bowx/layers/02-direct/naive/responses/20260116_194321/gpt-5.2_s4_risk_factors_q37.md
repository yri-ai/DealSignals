The document does **not** describe any specific “exit” or “refinancing” strategy for WeWork’s lease obligations in the way you’d see for debt (e.g., refinancing maturities). Instead, it frames WeWork’s approach as **portfolio optimization / lease restructuring**:

- **Lease exits and amendments (renegotiation strategy):** As part of its strategic restructuring, WeWork has been negotiating **lease amendments and/or full or partial exits** for locations with “more limited prospects of profitability.” The filing states that **over 500 lease amendments/exits** were negotiated globally, resulting in about **$6.9 billion reduction in future lease payments** and about **$1.1 billion reduction in lease security** (since Dec. 31, 2019; including ChinaCo prior to deconsolidation).

- **Use of alternative, more “asset-light” occupancy structures (structural strategy):** The company notes it is increasingly pursuing **management agreements, participating leases, and other occupancy arrangements** rather than traditional long-term fixed leases, to reduce fixed rent exposure.

- **Funding/liquidity support is discussed at the SPAC level, not as lease refinancing:** Cash sources around the transaction (trust + PIPE) are described as supporting ongoing operations, but the filing does **not** set out a plan to refinance lease liabilities the way it discusses debt/letter-of-credit facilities.

So, based on the document, the “exit strategy” for lease obligations is **negotiating lease restructurings/exits and shifting toward more flexible partner/managed models**, rather than refinancing lease obligations.
