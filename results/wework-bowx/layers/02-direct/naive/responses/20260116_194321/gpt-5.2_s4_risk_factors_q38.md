Post‑merger, BowX planned to operate as **“New WeWork” (renamed WeWork Inc.)** and make several business model and operating changes that were already underway at WeWork and expected to continue after closing:

- **Shift to a “leaner, more efficient” operating model focused on profitability/Adjusted EBITDA**, emphasizing expense management and streamlined operations rather than rapid footprint expansion.

- **Optimize the existing real estate portfolio** (continuing the global review of locations), including **negotiating lease amendments/exits** and pursuing **strategic lease restructurings** for underperforming sites.

- **Move toward more “asset‑light” structures** beyond traditional long-term leasing, including **management agreements, participating leases, variable-rent arrangements, and regional joint ventures/strategic partnerships** with real estate owners/operators.

- **Build/expand a platform business**: develop a **technology/services platform** that landlords and other operators could use to **power and manage flexible space** in their portfolios (leveraging WeWork systems and customer base).

- **Broaden/scale flexible workspace product offerings** across customer segments, including **WeWork On Demand (pay‑as‑you‑go)**, **WeWork All Access (subscription)**, and a **marketplace for business/tech services**.

- **Governance/organizational changes at close**: BowX’s non‑continuing directors/officers (other than Vivek Ranadivé) would resign; a **new 9‑member board** and WeWork’s management team would run the combined company, alongside NYSE listing under “WE”.
