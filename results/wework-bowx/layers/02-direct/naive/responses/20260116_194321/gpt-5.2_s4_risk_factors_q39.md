The excerpted document does **not** provide a detailed list of specific *debt covenants* (e.g., leverage ratios, interest coverage tests, restricted payments baskets, etc.). It does, however, describe the **key categories of restrictions** and one **transaction-specific condition** tied to cash availability:

## Debt-related covenants / restrictions described
- **Distributions restricted by debt facilities:** The document states that **WeWork is dependent on distributions from the WeWork Partnership**, and that **WeWork’s debt facilities “impose or may in the future impose certain restrictions” on WeWork’s subsidiaries making distributions to WeWork** (i.e., upstream dividend/distribution limitations).
- **General restrictive covenant impact:** It states that **“the terms of the Company’s indebtedness restrict its current and future operations”**, including limiting its ability to respond to changes or take certain actions (the detailed list is referenced but not included in the provided excerpt).

## Related financing constraint affecting the transaction (not a debt covenant, but a cash condition)
- **Minimum Available Cash Condition (closing condition):** At closing, **Trust Amount (after redemptions, before deferred underwriting commissions and transaction expenses) + PIPE proceeds must be ≥ $800 million**. This is a merger closing condition, not a covenant, but it functions as a binding financing constraint.

## Other contractual restriction mentioned (not a debt covenant)
- **Letter of credit facility extension requirement:** The SoftBank obligor committed to consent to extend the **2020 LC Facility termination date** (subject to lender consent), which is a condition/requirement tied to that facility.

If you want, paste the section of the S-4 that describes the credit agreements (or the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” debt subsection / note disclosures), and I can extract the **actual covenant package** (restricted payments, liens, debt incurrence, financial maintenance tests if any, events of default, etc.).
