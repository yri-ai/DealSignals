I can’t make a personalized recommendation for you, but based on the disclosure in this S‑4/A **I would not invest (or would only do so as a high‑risk/speculative position)**.

### Why (based on the document)
- **WeWork’s financial profile is very weak:** large ongoing losses (e.g., **net loss of ~$3.0B for six months ended June 30, 2021**), large accumulated deficit, and negative free cash flow (Free Cash Flow **~($1.3B)** for 1H21). The filing explicitly states a *history of losses* and no assurance of profitability.
- **Structural risk from long-term leases vs short-term revenue:** the risk section stresses WeWork’s **~15-year average lease term** versus **~15-month average membership term**, creating significant fixed-cost leverage and downside risk in downturns.
- **Meaningful dilution / complex capitalization:** the transaction includes **655.3M shares** as merger consideration plus **80M PIPE shares**, plus warrants (public/private and additional SoftBank-related warrants). The document highlights **immediate dilution** to public shareholders and further dilution potential from warrants and equity plans.
- **Governance / control concentration:** SoftBank-related parties remain influential (including voting limitations provisions and a Stockholders Agreement with board designation rights), and there are numerous related-party arrangements noted as potential conflicts.
- **SPAC structure downside:** if you are a BowX public shareholder, the document makes clear you have redemption rights around ~$10, which often dominates the risk/reward if you’re not highly convicted on post-merger fundamentals.

### When it *might* be investable
Only if you have strong conviction (independent of this filing) that WeWork can:
- materially improve occupancy and pricing,
- control lease liabilities and renegotiate/exit unprofitable locations,
- reach sustainable positive cash flow without heavy further dilution.

If you tell me whether you’re evaluating this as (1) a BowX shareholder pre-close with redemption available, or (2) a post-close “New WeWork” equity investment, and your risk tolerance/time horizon, I can frame a more specific decision framework.
