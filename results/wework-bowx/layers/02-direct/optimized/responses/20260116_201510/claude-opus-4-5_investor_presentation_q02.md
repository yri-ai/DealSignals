## Analysis: Revenue Growth Rate Year-over-Year

**Answer: Not found in document**

The provided document does not contain specific revenue figures or revenue growth rate percentages that would allow me to determine the year-over-year revenue growth rate. 

### Document Content Review:

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (dated 2021, likely related to their SPAC merger), but the extracted text primarily contains:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Company values statements (integrity, collaboration, gratitude, etc.)
- Brief mentions of product offerings like "All Access" subscription model
- Bullet point placeholders without associated numerical content
- A timeline reference spanning "2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030"

### Caveats and Limitations:

1. **Document Extraction Issue**: The document text appears to be incomplete or improperly extracted, with many slides showing only formatting elements (bullet points) without the actual content
2. **Missing Financial Data**: No specific revenue figures, growth rates, or financial projections are visible in the provided text
3. **Confidential Markings**: The repeated "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." suggests this is a presentation deck, but the substantive financial content is not captured in the provided text

**Confidence Level: N/A** (Information not available in document)

### Recommendation:
To properly answer this question, the full document with properly extracted financial tables, charts, and projections would be needed. The original PDF or presentation file should be re-processed to capture numerical data and financial metrics.
