Based on my review of the provided document, I cannot find specific operating loss figures for any period.

**Answer: Not found in document**

The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger), but the extracted text content consists primarily of:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers without accompanying text
- Company values and mission statements (page mentioning integrity, collaboration, etc.)
- Product descriptions (All Access subscription service)
- Timeline markers (2010-2030)

No financial figures, operating losses, revenue numbers, or specific financial metrics are visible in the extracted document text.

**Confidence: N/A** (information not present)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
- The document appears to have been extracted in a way that captured formatting elements (bullet points, copyright footers) but may have lost actual content, charts, graphs, or tables that would typically contain financial data
- A WeWork SPAC presentation would normally include detailed financial information including operating losses, but this data is not accessible in the provided text extraction
