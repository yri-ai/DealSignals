## Cash Burn Rate Analysis

**Finding: Not found in document**

After reviewing the provided document, I was unable to locate specific information regarding WeWork's cash burn rate. The document appears to be a presentation deck (likely an investor presentation based on the 2021 copyright and SPAC-related context), but the actual content visible consists primarily of:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers without associated text
- Company values/mission statements (referencing integrity, collaboration, community, etc.)
- References to product offerings like "All Access" subscription model
- Timeline markers (2010-2030)
- Various structural elements (bullet points, section breaks)

**Limitations:**
- The document text appears to be incomplete or improperly extracted, showing mostly formatting elements rather than substantive financial data
- No financial statements, cash flow data, or operating metrics containing burn rate information are visible in the provided text
- Key financial pages that would typically contain cash burn analysis appear to be missing or unreadable

**Confidence Level: N/A** - Cannot provide a confidence rating as the information is not present in the document.

**Recommendation:** To properly assess WeWork's cash burn rate, you would need access to:
1. Cash flow statements
2. Operating expense breakdowns
3. Liquidity analysis sections
4. Pro forma financial projections

These materials should be requested separately or obtained from other due diligence sources.
