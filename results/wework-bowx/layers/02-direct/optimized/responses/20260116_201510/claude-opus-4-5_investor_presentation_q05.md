# Analysis: Cash Runway at Current Burn Rate

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain the specific information needed to calculate or determine the cash runway at current burn rate. The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021, but the extracted text contains mostly:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential")
- Bullet point markers without content
- Company values and cultural statements
- General product descriptions (e.g., "All Access" subscription model)
- Timeline indicators (2010-2030)

**Missing Information Required:**
1. Current cash and cash equivalents balance
2. Monthly or quarterly burn rate
3. Operating cash flow data
4. Any explicit cash runway projections

## Confidence Level

**N/A** - Cannot provide a confidence rating as the required financial data is not present in the document.

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **Document Quality Issue**: The extracted text appears incomplete or corrupted, with most substantive content missing (only bullet points and headers visible without associated data)

2. **Slides Not Fully Rendered**: The document structure suggests this is a presentation deck where financial tables and charts were not captured in the text extraction

3. **Recommendation**: To answer this question, please provide:
   - A clearer version of the document with readable financial data
   - Specific pages containing cash position and burn rate information
   - The full investor presentation with visible tables and figures
