# Analysis of Key Assumptions Underlying Projections

## Finding: Not Found in Document

After reviewing the provided document, I was unable to identify the specific key assumptions underlying WeWork's financial projections. 

### What the Document Contains:

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (© 2021 WeWork) that includes:

1. **Company Values** (Page 11) - describing principles like integrity, collaboration, boldness, gratitude, and humanity

2. **Product Description** - Reference to "All Access" product described as:
   - On-demand pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription
   - Generates partnerships and top-of-funnel demand
   - Drives occupancy beyond physical capacity
   - High incremental margins from subscription model

3. **Timeline** - A timeline spanning 2010-2030 is referenced but details are not visible

4. **Definitions Section** (Page 51) - Contains bullet points that appear to define metrics, but the actual text/content of these definitions is not visible in the provided extraction

### Limitations:

The document extraction appears to contain primarily:
- Copyright notices and "Confidential" markers
- Bullet point placeholders without visible content
- Section headers without accompanying detail

**The actual numerical assumptions, growth rates, market penetration assumptions, pricing assumptions, cost assumptions, or other projection inputs are not visible in the extracted text.**

## Confidence Level: N/A

**Caveat:** This appears to be an incomplete document extraction where much of the substantive content (particularly charts, tables, and detailed text) was not captured. A complete review would require access to the full presentation with all visual and textual content intact.
