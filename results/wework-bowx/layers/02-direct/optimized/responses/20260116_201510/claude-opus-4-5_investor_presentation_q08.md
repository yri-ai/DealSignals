## Analysis: Contribution Margin Per Membership

**Answer: Not found in document**

The provided document does not contain specific information about contribution margin per membership. 

### What the Document Contains:

The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021, but the extracted text primarily shows:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point placeholders (•, ●, ○)
- Company values statements (page mentioning integrity, collaboration, etc.)
- General business model descriptions (All Access product features)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030

### Limitations:

1. **Document Quality Issue**: The extracted text appears to be incomplete or improperly rendered - most pages show only bullet point symbols without the actual content that would contain financial metrics.

2. **Missing Financial Data**: While page references mention terms like "High Margins" and "incremental margins" in the context of the All Access product, no specific contribution margin figures or per-membership calculations are visible in the extracted text.

3. **Definitions Section**: One page appears to contain definitions (showing "divided by" language), but the actual metric definitions and values are not legible in the provided text.

### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not found)

### Recommendation:
To properly answer this question, I would need:
- Access to the complete financial projections section
- The definitions/glossary page with readable content
- Any unit economics or per-member metrics tables
