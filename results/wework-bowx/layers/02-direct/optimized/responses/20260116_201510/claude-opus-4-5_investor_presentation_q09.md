## Analysis: Revenue Per Available Desk/Workstation

**Answer:** Not found in document.

The provided document consists almost entirely of copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") and bullet points without any visible content. While there appear to be section headers and bullet point structures referenced throughout, the actual text content, data, figures, and metrics are not visible in the extracted document text.

Specifically, I cannot locate:
- Revenue figures
- Desk/workstation counts
- Revenue per desk calculations
- Any financial metrics or operational data

**Confidence Level:** N/A - The information is not accessible in the provided document.

**Caveats and Limitations:**
1. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, likely an investor presentation for the SPAC merger based on context
2. The actual content of slides/pages is not visible in the extraction - only copyright footers and formatting elements (bullet points) are shown
3. There are references to what appears to be financial metrics and definitions on pages near the end (mentioning terms like "divided by"), but the specific values and complete definitions are not readable
4. The document mentions "All Access" products, occupancy, and margins conceptually, but no specific numerical data is accessible

**Recommendation:** Request a properly extracted or OCR-processed version of this document to conduct meaningful due diligence analysis on revenue metrics.
