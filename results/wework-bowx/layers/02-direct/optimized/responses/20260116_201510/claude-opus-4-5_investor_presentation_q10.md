# Analysis: Occupancy Rate and Trends

## Answer

**Not found in document** - The provided document does not contain specific occupancy rate figures or historical trend data showing actual occupancy percentages over time.

## What the Document Does Mention

The document makes **one reference to occupancy** in the context of the "All Access" product offering:

> "**Drives Occupancy** - Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections"

*Source: Page containing "All Access" product description (approximately page 25-26 based on document flow)*

This indicates that the All Access subscription model is designed as a mechanism to improve occupancy rates, but no actual occupancy metrics, percentages, or historical trends are provided.

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **Document appears heavily redacted**: The document consists primarily of copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") with bullet points that have had their content removed
2. **No numerical data visible**: Financial metrics, percentages, and specific figures appear to have been stripped from the document
3. **Timeline reference without data**: There is a timeline showing years 2010-2030, but no corresponding data points are visible

## Confidence Level

**LOW** - The document does not contain the requested information. The reference to occupancy is conceptual (describing a product feature) rather than providing actual performance metrics.

## Recommendation for Due Diligence

Request supplementary materials that include:
- Historical occupancy rates by quarter/year
- Occupancy by geography/market
- Mature vs. new location occupancy comparison
- Occupancy projections underlying financial forecasts
