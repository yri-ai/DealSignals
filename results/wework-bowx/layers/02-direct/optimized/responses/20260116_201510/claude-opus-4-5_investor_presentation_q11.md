## Analysis: Member Churn Rate

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** I have carefully reviewed the provided document, which appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021. The document contains primarily confidential headers/footers, company values statements, bullet point placeholders, and general descriptions of their "All Access" product offering. However, the actual content, data, and metrics appear to be missing or redacted from this version of the document.

The document mentions various business concepts including:
- All Access subscription model (page with "All Access" header)
- References to occupancy and utilization projections
- Timeline from 2010-2030
- Various bullet-pointed sections

However, **no specific member churn rate figure or churn-related data** is visible in the provided text.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (that the information is not present in the document as provided)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The document appears to be incomplete or heavily redacted - many pages show only "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." headers with bullet points but no actual content
2. The presentation structure suggests there should be financial metrics and KPIs, but the specific data is not visible in the provided text
3. Churn rate would typically be included in a SPAC merger presentation, so this may be in sections not included or in redacted portions
