## Analysis: Business Performance at 70% Occupancy

**Answer:** Not found in document.

The provided document does not contain specific information about what happens to the business at 70% occupancy. While the document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation (based on the © 2021 WeWork. Confidential. footers throughout), the actual content visible in the provided text consists primarily of:

- Copyright notices
- Bullet point markers (•, ●, ○) without accompanying text
- Company values statements (page mentioning "right thing," collaboration, etc.)
- Brief mentions of product features like "All Access" subscription model
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030
- References to definitions/metrics on what appears to be a later page

**What the document does reference regarding occupancy:**
- The "All Access" product section mentions that it "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections" - however, this does not address the specific 70% threshold question.

**Confidence Level:** N/A - Information not present in document

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The document provided appears to be heavily redacted or the actual content is missing - mostly showing formatting elements (bullet points, copyright notices) without substantive text
2. Financial metrics and occupancy thresholds that would typically appear in a SPAC investor presentation are not visible in the provided text
3. A complete analysis would require the full readable content of the presentation slides

**Recommendation:** Request the complete, unredacted document to properly analyze occupancy-related business metrics and breakeven thresholds.
