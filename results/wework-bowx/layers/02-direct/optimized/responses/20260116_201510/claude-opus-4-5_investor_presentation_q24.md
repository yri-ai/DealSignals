# Analysis: Management's Incentives/Compensation in the Deal

## Finding: Not found in document

After a thorough review of the provided document, I was unable to locate any information regarding management's incentives or compensation structure related to this SPAC merger deal.

## Document Content Summary:

The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021 that contains:
- Company values and culture statements (slide with "Do The Right Thing," "Better Together," "Be Bold," etc.)
- Business model information (All Access subscription product)
- Timeline graphic (2010-2030)
- Various bullet-pointed slides (content not visible in the extracted text)
- Definition/methodology slides (references to metrics)

## Limitations:

1. **Significant content gaps**: The document extraction shows mostly structural elements (bullet points, copyright notices) but the actual text content of most slides is not visible in the provided text.

2. **Missing key sections**: Standard SPAC presentation sections that would typically contain compensation information (such as "Transaction Overview," "Pro Forma Ownership," "Management Team," or "Use of Proceeds") are not readable in this document.

3. **No compensation-related keywords**: The document contains no references to executive compensation, equity grants, earnouts, lockups, employment agreements, or management incentive plans.

## Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not present)

## Recommendation:

To complete due diligence on management incentives, you would need to review:
- The merger proxy statement (DEF 14A/PREM14A)
- The S-4 registration statement
- Executive employment agreements filed as exhibits
- Any earnout or equity incentive plan disclosures
