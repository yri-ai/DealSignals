## Analysis: Material Litigation or Disputes

### Finding: **Not found in document**

The provided document does not contain any information regarding material litigation, legal disputes, pending lawsuits, regulatory actions, or legal proceedings involving WeWork.

### Document Content Assessment

The document appears to be a confidential WeWork presentation from 2021 (likely an investor presentation for the SPAC merger), containing:
- Company values and mission statements (page 11 area - discussing integrity, trust, collaboration)
- Business model descriptions (including "All Access" subscription product)
- Timeline spanning 2010-2030
- Various bullet points (though specific content is not fully visible in the extraction)
- Financial definitions/metrics section (referencing calculations and divided by notations)

### Caveats and Limitations

1. **Document Quality**: The extracted text consists primarily of copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") and bullet point markers without substantive content between slides
2. **Missing Sections**: Standard investor presentations for SPAC mergers typically include a "Risk Factors" or "Legal Matters" section, but this is not visible in the provided extraction
3. **Incomplete Data**: The document appears to be a presentation deck where most slide content did not extract properly

### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not present)

### Recommendation

To complete due diligence on material litigation, the following documents should be requested:
- S-4 Registration Statement (which requires litigation disclosure)
- Form 8-K filings
- Legal due diligence memo
- Management representation letters regarding pending litigation
