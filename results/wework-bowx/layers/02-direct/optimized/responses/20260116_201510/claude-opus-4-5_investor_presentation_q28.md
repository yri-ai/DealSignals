# Analysis: Going Concern Disclosures

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp). However, the document content provided consists almost entirely of:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point placeholders without visible text content
- Corporate values statements
- General business model descriptions (All Access product, partnerships)
- Timeline graphics (2010-2030)
- Slide structure indicators

The actual financial disclosures, risk factors, and auditor opinions that would typically contain going concern language are not visible in the extracted text provided.

## Where Going Concern Disclosures Would Typically Appear

For a SPAC merger, going concern disclosures would normally be found in:
- The S-4/F-4 registration statement
- Historical audited financial statements
- Risk factors section
- Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A)

## Confidence Level

**N/A** - The document does not contain sufficient readable content to make a determination regarding going concern disclosures.

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **Document extraction issue**: The provided text appears to have formatting/extraction problems, with most substantive content not visible
2. **Document type limitation**: This appears to be a marketing/investor presentation rather than formal SEC filings or audited financial statements where going concern disclosures would be required
3. **Known context** (not from document): WeWork historically had going concern issues disclosed in their 2019 IPO attempt and subsequent filings, but this cannot be confirmed from the provided document
