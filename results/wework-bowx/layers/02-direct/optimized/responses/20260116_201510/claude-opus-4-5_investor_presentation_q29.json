  "content": "## Analysis: Auditor Statements\n\n**Answer:** Not found in document.\n\n**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger). However, the document content shared consists primarily of:\n- Copyright notices (\"\u00a9 2021 WeWork. Confidential.\")\n- Bullet point markers without visible text content\n- Company values/mission statements\n- Product descriptions (All Access subscription model)\n- Timeline references (2010-2030)\n- Various section indicators with bullet points\n\nThe document does not contain any auditor statements, auditor opinions, audit reports, or references to what auditors said about WeWork's financial statements or internal controls.\n\n**Confidence Level:** HIGH - I can definitively state that auditor commentary is not present in the provided document text.\n\n**Caveats/Limitations:**\n1. The document appears to be partially redacted or the text content from many slides was not fully captured in the extraction\n2. This appears to be a marketing/investor presentation rather than audited financial statements or SEC filings where auditor opinions would typically appear\n3. Auditor statements would more commonly be found in Form S-4, proxy statements, or the 10-K/annual report rather than an investor presentation\n\n**Recommendation:** To find auditor statements related to the WeWork SPAC merger, you should review:\n- The SEC Form S-4 registration statement\n- Any audited financial statements filed with the SEC\n- The PCAOB auditor's report accompanying financial statements",
