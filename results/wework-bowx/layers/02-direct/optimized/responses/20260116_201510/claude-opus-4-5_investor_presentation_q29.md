## Analysis: Auditor Statements

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger). However, the document content shared consists primarily of:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers without visible text content
- Company values/mission statements
- Product descriptions (All Access subscription model)
- Timeline references (2010-2030)
- Various section indicators with bullet points

The document does not contain any auditor statements, auditor opinions, audit reports, or references to what auditors said about WeWork's financial statements or internal controls.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - I can definitively state that auditor commentary is not present in the provided document text.

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The document appears to be partially redacted or the text content from many slides was not fully captured in the extraction
2. This appears to be a marketing/investor presentation rather than audited financial statements or SEC filings where auditor opinions would typically appear
3. Auditor statements would more commonly be found in Form S-4, proxy statements, or the 10-K/annual report rather than an investor presentation

**Recommendation:** To find auditor statements related to the WeWork SPAC merger, you should review:
- The SEC Form S-4 registration statement
- Any audited financial statements filed with the SEC
- The PCAOB auditor's report accompanying financial statements
