## Analysis: Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls

### Answer:
**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain any information regarding material weaknesses in internal controls. The document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation (dated 2021, likely related to their SPAC merger) that contains:

- Company values and culture statements
- Business model descriptions (including "All Access" product features)
- A timeline graphic (2010-2030)
- Various bullet points (content not visible in the extracted text)
- Financial definitions section (referenced on slides toward the end)

### What Would Be Expected:
Material weaknesses in internal controls would typically be disclosed in:
- Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) sections
- Auditor's reports
- SEC filings (10-K, S-1, S-4 for SPAC mergers)
- Risk factors sections

### Caveats and Limitations:
1. **Document Quality Issue**: The extracted text shows mostly formatting elements (bullet points, copyright notices) without substantive content, suggesting either a heavily redacted document or an extraction issue with graphics/tables
2. **Document Type**: This appears to be an investor presentation deck rather than audited financial statements or SEC filings where internal control disclosures would typically appear
3. **Incomplete Information**: Much of the actual content appears to be in visual/graphical format that was not captured in the text extraction

### Confidence Level: 
**N/A** - Cannot assess what is not present in the document

### Recommendation:
To assess material weaknesses in internal controls, request and review:
- WeWork's S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC
- Historical 10-K filings (if any)
- Independent auditor's report on internal controls
- Any management letters from auditors
