## Analysis: Voting Structure Post-Merger

**Answer: Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain specific information about the voting structure post-merger. The document appears to be a WeWork presentation (marked "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential" throughout), but the actual content/text of the slides is largely missing or redacted - only bullet point markers, copyright notices, and some general corporate values text are visible.

The visible content includes:
- Corporate values statements (integrity, collaboration, etc.)
- References to an "All Access" subscription product
- Timeline showing years 2010-2030
- Various bullet point structures without visible content

**What would typically be needed:**
For a complete SPAC merger voting structure analysis, I would need to find:
- Share class structure (common vs. preferred shares)
- Voting rights per share class
- Any super-voting shares
- Founder/sponsor voting arrangements
- Lock-up provisions affecting voting control

**Confidence Level: N/A** (Information not present in document)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The document appears to be a slide deck where most substantive content is not visible/rendered
2. Only formatting elements (bullet points, copyright notices) are shown for most pages
3. This appears to be a marketing/overview presentation rather than a detailed merger proxy or S-4 filing that would contain voting structure details

**Recommendation:** Request the complete S-4 registration statement, merger proxy, or shareholder agreement to obtain voting structure information.
