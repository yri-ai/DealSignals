## Analysis: Lock-up Agreements

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** After reviewing the provided document, I was unable to locate any information regarding lock-up agreements. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (dated 2021), but the extracted text content consists primarily of:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers without accompanying text
- Corporate values statements (regarding integrity, collaboration, gratitude, etc.)
- Brief descriptions of their "All Access" product offering
- Timeline references (2010-2030)

The document does not contain specific information about:
- Lock-up periods for shareholders
- Lock-up terms for insiders, sponsors, or PIPE investors
- Release schedules or conditions for locked-up shares
- Any other lock-up agreement provisions

**Confidence Level:** N/A (information not present)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The document text extraction appears incomplete - many bullet points and sections show markers but no actual content
2. This appears to be a partial or corrupted extraction of what may be an investor presentation
3. Lock-up agreements would typically be found in the definitive proxy statement, merger agreement, or S-4 registration statement rather than an investor presentation
4. To properly answer this question, additional transaction documents would need to be reviewed
