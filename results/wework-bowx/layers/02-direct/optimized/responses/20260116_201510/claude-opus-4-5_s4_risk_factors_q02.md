Based on the document, I can calculate the revenue growth rate year-over-year from the Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork section.

**Revenue figures from the Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (page 23):**
- Year ended December 31, 2018: $1,821,751 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2019: $3,458,592 thousand
- Year ended December 31, 2020: $3,415,865 thousand

**Year-over-Year Revenue Growth Rates:**

1. **2018 to 2019:** Revenue grew from $1.82 billion to $3.46 billion, representing approximately **89.8% growth**

2. **2019 to 2020:** Revenue declined from $3.46 billion to $3.42 billion, representing approximately **-1.2% decline**

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, revenue was $1,191,331 thousand ($1.19 billion), which compared to half of 2020's annual revenue (~$1.71 billion) suggests continued revenue pressure.

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - These figures are directly stated in the financial statements.

**Caveats:**
- The document notes that "WeWork's historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future" (page 23)
- The 2020 revenue decline and 2021 results were significantly impacted by COVID-19, as extensively discussed in the Risk Factors section (pages 31-32)
- The document states that between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, "total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%" (page 31)
