## Analysis of Cash Burn Rate

Based on the provided document, I can derive information about WeWork's cash burn rate from the financial data presented.

### Cash Flow Information

From the **Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data** (page 24):

| Period | Net Cash Used in Operating Activities |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 | $(1,158,957) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2020 | $(857,008) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2019 | $(448,244) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2018 | $(176,729) thousand |

### Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Measure)

From page 25, the document provides **Free Cash Flow** figures (defined as cash flow from operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment):

| Period | Free Cash Flow |
|--------|----------------|
| Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 | $(1,312,099) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2020 | $(2,298,240) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2019 | $(3,936,330) thousand |
| Year Ended December 31, 2018 | $(2,231,749) thousand |

### Implied Cash Burn Rate

Based on the six months ended June 30, 2021:
- **Operating cash burn**: Approximately **$2.3 billion annualized** (based on $1.16B for 6 months)
- **Free cash flow burn**: Approximately **$2.6 billion annualized** (based on $1.31B for 6 months)

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM** - These figures are calculated/derived from the stated cash flow data rather than a directly stated "cash burn rate."

**Caveats**: 
- The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted these figures (page 31-32)
- Historical burn rates have been declining year-over-year, suggesting operational improvements
- Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure as defined by the company (page 25)
