## Cash Runway Analysis

Based on the document provided, I can identify relevant financial information but cannot calculate a precise cash runway figure.

### Available Cash Information

**As of June 30, 2021 (Pro Forma Combined):**
- Total current assets: $2,604,424 thousand (assuming no redemptions) or $2,172,113 thousand (assuming maximum redemptions) - Page 27, Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement

**WeWork Historical Cash Flow:**
- Net cash used in operating activities for six months ended June 30, 2021: $(1,158,957) thousand - Page 24, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data
- Net cash used in operating activities for year ended December 31, 2020: $(857,008) thousand - Page 24

**BowX Trust Account:**
- Funds in trust account as of June 30, 2021: approximately $483.1 million - Page xxiv

### Limitations in Calculating Cash Runway

**Not found in document:** The document does not provide:
1. A clear total cash and cash equivalents figure for the combined entity post-closing
2. A projected monthly or quarterly burn rate going forward
3. Management's explicit cash runway projections

### Relevant Context

The document notes that WeWork's Free Cash Flow was:
- $(1,312,099) thousand for six months ended June 30, 2021
- $(2,298,240) thousand for year ended December 31, 2020

This represents an annualized burn rate improvement, though the document cautions that "WeWork's historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future" (Page 23).

**Confidence: LOW** - The document provides historical cash flow data and pro forma assets, but does not explicitly calculate or disclose the cash runway at current burn rate. Any calculation would require significant inference and assumptions not supported by direct statements in the document.
