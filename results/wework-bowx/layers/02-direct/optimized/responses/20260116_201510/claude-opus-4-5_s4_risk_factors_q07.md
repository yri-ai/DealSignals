## Key Assumptions Underlying the Projections

Based on my review of the provided document, I was unable to find a specific section detailing the key assumptions underlying financial projections or forecasts for WeWork or the combined company.

**What the document does contain:**

The document includes certain assumptions related to the **pro forma financial calculations** and **share ownership calculations**, specifically:

1. **Share Redemption Scenarios** (Page 26-27, "Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information"):
   - "Assuming No Redemption: This presentation assumes that no public stockholders of BowX exercise redemption rights"
   - "Assuming Maximum Possible Redemption: This presentation assumes 43,231,098 of the public shares are redeemed for their pro rata share of the funds in BowX's trust account"

2. **Exchange Ratio Assumptions** (Page 8, footnote):
   - Assumptions include "(a) the vesting of all shares of New WeWork Common Stock received in respect of the New WeWork Restricted Stock Awards, (b) the vesting and exercise of all in-the-money New WeWork Options for shares of New WeWork Common Stock, (c) the vesting of all New WeWork Restricted Stock Units..."

3. **Merger Consideration Calculation** (Page x-xi, "Selected Definitions"):
   - The document details the calculation methodology for "Aggregate Fully Diluted WeWork Capital Stock" including treatment of options, warrants, and restricted stock units.

**Not Found in Document:**

The document does **not contain** detailed assumptions underlying:
- Revenue projections
- Growth rate assumptions
- Market share assumptions
- Operating expense projections
- Cash flow projections
- EBITDA projections

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

**Caveat:** This is an S-4/A registration statement which focuses on the legal terms of the merger transaction rather than detailed financial projections. Key projection assumptions would typically be found in investor presentations, fairness opinions, or management's financial forecasts, which are not included in this document. The document explicitly notes (Page 16) that "BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider."
