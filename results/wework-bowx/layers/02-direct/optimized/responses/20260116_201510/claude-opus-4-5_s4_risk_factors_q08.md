**Not found in document**

The document does not contain information about contribution margin per membership. This S-4/A registration statement provides extensive information about the BowX-WeWork merger transaction, including:

- Revenue figures and membership counts
- Operating expenses and losses
- Adjusted EBITDA metrics
- Various financial statements and pro forma information

However, the document does not disclose or calculate a contribution margin per membership figure. While the document contains references to:
- Total memberships and membership trends (noting a 16% decline between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021 - page 31)
- Membership and service revenue percentages from Enterprise Members (50% for six months ended June 30, 2021 - page 42)
- Average membership agreement terms (15 months - page 34)

There is no specific contribution margin calculation on a per-membership basis provided in this filing.

**Confidence: HIGH** - I have thoroughly reviewed the document and can confirm this metric is not disclosed.

**Caveats/Limitations**: 
- The document does reference various revenue and cost metrics that could theoretically be used to derive such a figure, but the actual contribution margin per membership is not explicitly stated
- WeWork's non-GAAP financial measures section (pages 24-25) discusses Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, but not contribution margin per membership
