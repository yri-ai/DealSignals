Not found in document.

The document does not contain information about revenue per available desk or workstation. While the document discusses WeWork's business model, memberships, revenue figures (such as $1,191,331 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021 - page 23), and mentions workstations in the context of Physical Occupancy definition ("the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations" - page xiii), it does not provide a metric or calculation for revenue per available desk/workstation.

**Confidence: HIGH** - I have thoroughly reviewed the document and can confirm this specific metric is not disclosed.
