Based on my review of the provided document, I can find information about occupancy-related metrics, but the document does not contain comprehensive occupancy rate data or trend analysis.

## Findings:

**Definition Found:**
The document defines "Physical Occupancy" as "the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations" (page xvii, Selected Definitions section).

**Limited Trend Information:**
The document mentions membership declines but does not provide specific occupancy rate percentages or detailed trends:

- "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%" (page 31, Risk Factors section)

- The document references "Non-Mature Locations" (open less than 12 months) and "Mature Locations" (open longer than 12 months) as categories for analyzing location performance (page xiii), but does not provide occupancy rates for these categories in the excerpts provided.

**COVID-19 Impact:**
The document notes that WeWork "experienced a reduction in new sales volume at its locations, which negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the Company's results of operations" due to COVID-19 (page 31).

## Answer:

**Not found in document** - While the document defines Physical Occupancy as a metric, specific occupancy rate percentages and detailed trend data are not provided in the excerpted portions of this S-4/A filing.

**Confidence: HIGH** for the definition; **LOW** for trend analysis (insufficient data provided in document).

**Caveats:** This S-4/A document is focused on the SPAC merger transaction details rather than comprehensive operational metrics. More detailed occupancy information may be contained in WeWork's separate financial statements or MD&A sections not fully excerpted in the provided text.
