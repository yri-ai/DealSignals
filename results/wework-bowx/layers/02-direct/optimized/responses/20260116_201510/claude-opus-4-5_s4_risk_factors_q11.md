## Answer

**Not found in document.**

The document does not provide a specific member churn rate metric or percentage. While the document discusses member churn conceptually and provides related membership data, it does not state an explicit churn rate.

### Related Information Found:

The document does mention several related data points about membership changes:

1. **Membership decline**: "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%." (Page 31-32, Risk Factors section)

2. **Month-to-month memberships**: "During the six months ended June 30, 2021, on average, approximately 10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments and could be terminated in a given month." (Page 33, Risk Factors section)

3. **Monthly renewal rate**: "During the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 6% of physical memberships (excluding month-to-month commitments) came up for renewal each month on average." (Page 33, Risk Factors section)

4. **Relocation retention**: "As of June 30, 2021, the Company has retained approximately 90% of relocated members" (Page 34, Risk Factors section)

### Confidence: LOW

The document references "churn" as a risk factor (e.g., "The Company has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, higher levels of membership agreement terminations" and "increased churn and non-payment from members") but does not quantify an actual churn rate metric.
