Based on the document, I can provide the following information about the duration profile of lease commitments:

## Lease Duration Profile

**Average Lease Term: Approximately 15 years**

The document states: "The average length of the initial term of its leases is approximately 15 years" (page 34, Risk Factors section).

**Comparison to Membership Agreements:**
The document contrasts this with membership agreement terms: "the average term of its membership agreements is 15 months" (page 34).

**Total Future Lease Obligations:**
As of June 30, 2021, "the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was $36.6 billion" (page 34).

**Security Coverage:**
The document notes that "the total security packages... provided by the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of those lease obligations was approximately $6.5 billion, representing less than 20% of future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations" (page 34).

**Additional Context on Membership Duration:**
- "During the six months ended June 30, 2021, on average, approximately 10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments"
- "During the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 6% of physical memberships (excluding month-to-month commitments) came up for renewal each month on average" (page 33)

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - These figures are directly stated in the document.

**Caveat:** The document highlights the mismatch between long-term lease commitments (~15 years) and shorter-term membership agreements (~15 months average) as a significant risk factor for the company's operating flexibility and liquidity.
