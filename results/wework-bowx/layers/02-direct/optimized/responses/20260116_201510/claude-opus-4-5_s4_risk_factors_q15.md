## Lease Termination Provisions

Based on the document provided, here are the key findings regarding lease termination provisions:

### Primary Finding: Limited Early Termination Rights

The document explicitly states that **WeWork's leases are primarily entered into by special purpose entity subsidiaries and "do not contain early termination provisions"** with limited exceptions.

**Citation:** "The Company currently leases a significant majority of its locations under long-term leases that, with limited exceptions, do not contain early termination provisions." (Page 34, Risk Factors section - "The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company's leases may limit the Company's operating flexibility")

### Key Characteristics of WeWork's Lease Obligations:

1. **Average Lease Term:** The average length of the initial term of leases is approximately **15 years** (Page 34)

2. **Fixed Payment Structure:** "The Company's leases generally provide for fixed monthly or quarterly payments that are not tied to space utilization or the size of its member base, and nearly all of its leases contain minimum rental payment obligations." (Page 34)

3. **Future Lease Obligations:** As of June 30, 2021, future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was **$36.6 billion** (Page 34)

4. **Security Coverage:** Total security packages (corporate guarantees, letters of credit, cash deposits, surety bonds) provided in respect of lease obligations was approximately **$6.5 billion**, representing less than 20% of future undiscounted minimum lease obligations (Page 34)

### Portfolio Optimization Efforts:

The document notes that WeWork has negotiated over **500 lease amendments and/or exits** with landlord partners, resulting in approximately **$6.9 billion reduction** to future lease payments since December 31, 2019. (Page 37)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - These provisions are directly stated in the document.

**Caveats:** 
- The document mentions "limited exceptions" to the no-early-termination rule but does not specify what those exceptions are
- There are references to a "small number of leases under a revenue sharing model with no minimum rent amount" which may have different termination terms
- Lease termination costs incurred have been "substantially all being equal to or less than the security coverage of each lease" (Page 38)
