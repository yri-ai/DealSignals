After carefully reviewing the provided S-4/A document, I could not locate any specific information about what happens to the business at 70% occupancy or any discussion of a 70% occupancy threshold and its implications for WeWork's business operations, profitability, or financial metrics.

The document does contain references to occupancy-related concepts, including:
- A definition of "Physical Occupancy" as "the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations" (page x, Selected Definitions section)
- References to "Mature Locations" (locations open for longer than 12 months) and "Non-Mature Locations" (locations open for less than 12 months)
- Discussions about member churn and occupancy challenges related to COVID-19

However, there is no specific analysis or discussion of what occurs at a 70% occupancy level in terms of profitability breakeven, cost coverage, or operational performance.

**Confidence: HIGH** (that the information is not present in the document)

**Caveat:** The document is an S-4/A registration statement focused on the SPAC merger transaction details, and while it contains risk factors and business descriptions, detailed operational metrics like occupancy breakeven thresholds may be contained in other investor materials not included in this filing.
