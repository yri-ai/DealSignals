Based on the provided document, I can identify the following information about the implied enterprise value:

**Answer:** The anticipated initial pre-transaction enterprise value is **$8.8 billion**.

**Citation:** This is stated on page 16 of the document under "BowX's Board of Directors' Reasons for the Business Combination" in the bullet point titled "Attractive Initial Valuation":

> "Attractive Initial Valuation. WeWork will have an anticipated initial pre-transaction enterprise value of $8.8 billion."

**Additional Context:**
The document also states that the Aggregate Merger Consideration represents a **pre-transaction equity value of WeWork of approximately $6.553 billion** (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share for 655,300,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock). This is referenced on pages 1-2 and page 3 of the document.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - The enterprise value of $8.8 billion is directly stated in the document.

**Caveats/Limitations:**
- The $8.8 billion figure is described as "anticipated" and "pre-transaction," suggesting it was an estimate at the time of the filing
- The document distinguishes between enterprise value ($8.8 billion) and equity value ($6.553 billion), with the difference presumably reflecting net debt and other adjustments
- This information is from a document dated September 16, 2021, and actual values at closing may have differed
