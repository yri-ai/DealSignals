## Analysis of Valuation Methodology

Based on my review of the provided S-4/A document, **no formal third-party valuation methodology is disclosed to justify the transaction price**.

### Key Findings:

**1. No Third-Party Valuation or Fairness Opinion Obtained**

The document explicitly states:

> "The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination."

(Page xxxii, Q&A section)

**2. Board's Basis for Valuation Determination**

The document indicates that the BowX board relied on its own judgment:

> "The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders."

(Page xxxii, Q&A section)

**3. 80% Net Asset Test**

> "The BowX board of directors also determined, without seeking a valuation from a financial advisor, that WeWork's fair market value was at least 80% of BowX's net assets, excluding any taxes payable on interest earned."

(Page xxxii, Q&A section)

**4. Implied Valuation Metrics**

The document discloses the following transaction values:
- **Pre-transaction equity value of WeWork**: approximately **$6.553 billion** (at $10.00 per share deemed value)
- **Pre-transaction enterprise value**: approximately **$8.8 billion**

(Pages 2, 16)

### Confidence Level: **HIGH**

This is directly stated in the document - there is explicit disclosure that no fairness opinion or third-party valuation was obtained.

### Caveats and Limitations:

1. **Investor Reliance Risk**: The document explicitly warns that "investors will be relying on the judgment of the BowX board of directors... in valuing WeWork's business and assuming the risk that the BowX board of directors may not have properly valued such business." (Page xxxii)

2. **Potential Conflicts of Interest**: The document acknowledges that BowX's directors and officers have interests that may conflict with stockholders' interests in determining whether the Business Combination is appropriate. (Risk Factors section, page 20)

3. **No Disclosed Methodology**: The document does not describe any specific valuation methodology (DCF, comparable companies, precedent transactions, etc.) used by the board to arrive at the valuation figures.
