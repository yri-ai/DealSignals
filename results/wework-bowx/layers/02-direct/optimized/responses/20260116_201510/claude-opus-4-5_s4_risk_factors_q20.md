Based on my review of the provided document, **no comparable transactions or companies are cited** in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The document is an S-4/A registration statement for the BowX Acquisition Corp. SPAC merger with WeWork, and while it contains extensive information about:

- The transaction structure and terms
- Financial information for both BowX and WeWork
- Risk factors
- Pro forma financial statements
- Related agreements

The document does not include any section discussing comparable transactions, precedent transactions, or comparable company analyses that are sometimes included in merger documents or fairness opinions.

**Notably, the document explicitly states that no fairness opinion was obtained:**

From the section "Did the board of directors of BowX obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion":
> "No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders." (Page xxiii)

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - This is directly stated based on a thorough review of the document. The absence of comparable transaction analysis is explicitly noted through the disclosure that no independent fairness opinion was obtained.

**Caveat:** This document represents Amendment No. 5 to the Form S-4 and covers the registration statement pages provided. It is possible that supplementary materials filed separately with the SEC might contain comparable transaction analysis, but such analysis is not contained within this document.
