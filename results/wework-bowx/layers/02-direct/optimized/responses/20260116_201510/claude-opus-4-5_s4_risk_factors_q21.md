- Track record claims are general statements without detailed supporting evidence
- The document notes "there have been substantial changes in the Company's management and business plan" following challenges in 2019 (Page 37)
- The document acknowledges risks related to management turnover: "Changes to or turnover among senior management or other key personnel could disrupt the Company's strategic focus" (Page 38)
- WeWork has "reduced its global workforce by approximately 70%" since 2019 (Page 39)
