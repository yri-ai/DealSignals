SBWW is described as \"WeWork's largest stockholder\" (page v).\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 2. **Debt Financing Arrangements**\nAs of June 30, 2021, SoftBank's debt-related commitments to WeWork include:\n- **$1.7 billion** in outstanding letters of credit under the 2020 LC Facility\n- **$2.2 billion** in outstanding indebtedness under the SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt\n- Ability for WeWork to borrow up to **$1.1 billion** under the SoftBank Senior Secured Debt (subject to restrictive covenants)\n\n(Page 40, Risk Factors section)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 3. **Credit Support Letter Agreement**\nSoftBank Obligor has committed to consent to an extension of the termination date of the 2020 LC Facility from February 10, 2023 to no later than February 10, 2024 (the \"LC Facility Termination Extension\"). This extension requires requisite consent of lenders. (Page 7)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 4. **Commitment Letter for Secured Notes**\nStarBright WW LP (an affiliate of SBG) agreed to purchase up to **$550 million** of 7.50% senior secured notes from WeWork Companies LLC. These notes will mature on the earlier of: (a) 18 months from Closing, or (b) February 12, 2023. (Page 7)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 5. **Warrant Issuances to SoftBank**\n- **First Warrant**: SBWW will receive warrants to purchase approximately **39,115,176 shares** of New WeWork Class A Common Stock (at approximately $0.01 per share), with an estimated fair value of approximately **$391.2 million**. This is an inducement for SBWW's support in the automatic conversion of WeWork Preferred Stock. (Pages 7-8)\n- **LC Warrant**: SoftBank Obligor will receive warrants to purchase approximately **11,917,938 shares** of New WeWork Class A Common Stock as consideration for agreeing to continue as co-obligor under the LC Facility extension, with estimated fair value of approximately **$119.2 million**. (Page 8)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 6. **Voting Restrictions**\nUnder Organizational Documents Proposal B, SoftBank Holders will be restricted for at least two years from exercising voting rights over more than **49.9%** of voting securities present at any stockholder meeting. (Page 10)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 7. **Stockholder Support Agreement**\nSBWW entered into a Stockholder Support Agreement requiring it to deliver written consent approving the Business Combination within five (5) calendar days after the proxy statement/prospectus is declared effective. Notably, SBWW has consent rights over any proposed amendments or waivers to the Merger Agreement. (Page 5)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n### 8. **Stockholders Agreement**\nAt Closing, SBWW and SVFE will enter into a Stockholders Agreement providing them board nomination rights as long as they hold specified amounts of stock. (Page 7)\n\n**Confidence: HIGH**\n\n---\n\n### Caveats and Limitations:\n- The document notes that SoftBank's substantial stockholder position \"could present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations\" (page 40)\n- The LC Facility extension requires \"requisite consent of the lenders\" beyond SoftBank's commitment\n- Some arrangements are subject to closing conditions being met",
