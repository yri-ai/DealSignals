### WeWork Executive Transaction Bonuses

**Page 14-15 ("Interests of WeWork's Executive Officers in the Business Combination"):**

Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the following transaction bonuses will be paid:

| Executive | Bonus Amount |
|-----------|--------------|
| Sandeep Mathrani (CEO) | $10.0 million |
| Anthony Yazbeck | $2.0 million |
| Ben Dunham | $1.5 million |
| Jared DeMatteis | $1.5 million |
| Lauren Fritts | $1.0 million |
| Peter Greenspan | $1.0 million |

| Scott Morey | $300,000 |
| Maral Kazanjian | $250,000 |
| Roger Solé Rafols | $250,000 |

**Repayment Terms:** These bonuses are subject to repayment obligations - the full after-tax amount must be repaid if the executive resigns without good reason or is terminated for cause on or before January 31, 2022, and 50% of such amount must be repaid for such termination after January 31, 2022 but on or before January 31, 2023.

**Additional Bonus for Anthony Yazbeck:** In connection with his promotion to President & Chief Operating Officer, Yazbeck received a one-time bonus of GBP 1.44 million payable within 30 days following consummation of the Business Combination, subject to employment through payment date.

### Equity Award Vesting Acceleration

**Page 15:**

WeWork executives hold Restricted Stock Unit Awards with a liquidity event vesting condition. The Business Combination will satisfy this liquidity event condition. As of July 15, 2021:
- **4,347,818 RSUs** (assuming maximum performance metrics) were held by executive officers
- **8,863 RSUs** will be fully vested upon consummation
- The remainder will remain subject to additional service- and/or performance-based vesting requirements

### BowX Sponsor/Director Interests

**Pages 13-14 and 32:**

- Initial stockholders (including Sponsor) hold **12,075,000 shares of Class B Common Stock** and **7,773,333 private placement warrants** that would become worthless without completing the Business Combination
- Paid only **$25,000** for Class B Common Stock and **$11,660,000** for private placement warrants
- **Mr. Ranadivé** will continue as a director of New WeWork

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - These amounts are directly stated in the document.

**Caveats:** The executive bonus amounts (other than Mr. Mathrani's fixed $10 million) are described as "target amounts only" that may be adjusted at Mr. Mathrani's discretion, subject to an aggregate cap of $11.5 million.
