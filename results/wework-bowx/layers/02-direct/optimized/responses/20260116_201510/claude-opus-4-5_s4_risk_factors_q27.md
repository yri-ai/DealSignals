Based on my review of the provided document, I can identify the following information regarding material litigation and disputes:

## Material Litigation and Disputes

**1. Landlord Litigation Related to Real Estate Portfolio Optimization**

The document states that "In a small number of cases, the Company's real estate portfolio optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords. As the process continues, additional litigation could result and the Company could be exposed to breach of contract, eviction or other claims that could result in direct and indirect costs to the Company and could result in other operational disruptions that could harm its reputation, brand and results of operations." (Risk Factors section, page 38)

**2. Corporate Guarantee Enforcement**

The document notes that "a small number of landlords have sued to enforce the corporate guarantees." (Risk Factors section, page 35)

**3. 2019 IPO-Related Litigation and Investigations**

The document references "significant legal costs incurred by WeWork in connection with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork's 2019 withdrawn initial public offering" (Adjusted EBITDA definition, page 25). Additionally, the Company has "agreed to reimburse indemnified parties for certain legal expenses incurred and, in 2020, paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications, outside of the amounts covered by insurance." (Risk Factors section, page 41)

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

**Caveats and Limitations:**
- The document does not provide a comprehensive listing of all pending litigation matters
- Specific case names, damages sought, or current status of litigation are not detailed
- The full Risk Factors section appears to be truncated in the provided document, so additional litigation disclosures may exist in portions not included
