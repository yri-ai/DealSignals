The document includes extensive risk factors discussing WeWork's financial challenges, including:\n\n1. **History of losses** - WeWork had net losses of $3.0 billion (six months ended June 30, 2021), $3.8 billion (2020), $3.8 billion (2019), and $1.9 billion (2018), with accumulated deficits (Risk Factors section, page 34-35)\n\n2. **Liquidity risks** - References to WeWork's significant lease obligations, with future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations of $36.6 billion as of June 30, 2021 (Risk Factors section, page 34)\n\n3. **COVID-19 impacts** - Discussion of adverse impacts on cash flow and liquidity (Risk Factors section, pages 31-32)\n\n**Limitation:** The document provided appears to be truncated and does not include the complete financial statements or notes to financial statements where going concern disclosures would typically appear. The document references WeWork's consolidated financial statements \"included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus,\" but those actual financial statement notes are not included in the text provided.\n\n**Confidence Level: LOW** - The specific going concern disclosure language (typically found in Note 1 or Note 2 of financial statements) is not present in the provided document excerpt. A complete review of the full filing, including the financial statement notes, would be required to definitively answer this question.",
