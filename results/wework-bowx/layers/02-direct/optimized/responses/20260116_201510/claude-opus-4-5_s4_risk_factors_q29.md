## Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document is an S-4/A registration statement (Amendment No. 5) filed with the SEC on September 16, 2021 for the BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork merger. While the document references that there are audited financial statements included elsewhere in the proxy statement/prospectus, the actual auditor's opinion or report is not contained within the excerpted text provided.

The document does mention:
- "the audited historical financial statements of each of BowX and WeWork and the notes thereto" should be read in conjunction with other sections (Page 26, in the Selected Unaudited Pro Forma section)
- References to "WeWork's audited annual and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus" (Risk Factors section, page 32)
- The document indicates BowX is "not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act" as an emerging growth company (Page 18)

However, the actual auditor's report, opinion, or any specific statements from the auditors regarding their examination of the financial statements are not included in the document excerpt provided.

**Confidence: HIGH** - The document clearly does not contain auditor statements or opinions within the provided text, though it references that audited financial statements exist elsewhere in the full filing.

**Caveat:** The full S-4/A filing would contain the auditor's reports as part of the financial statements section (referenced as starting at page F-1), but this section was not included in the provided document excerpt.
