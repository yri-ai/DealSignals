Based on my review of the provided document, I found relevant information regarding internal controls.

**Answer:**

The document acknowledges concerns about internal controls but does not explicitly identify any specific material weaknesses that have been formally disclosed. However, the document does state that WeWork's internal controls need further development.

**Citation:**

On page 31, under "Risk Factors," the document lists among the key risks:

> "WeWork's internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company and a company of its global scale."

This indicates that while there are recognized deficiencies or areas requiring improvement in WeWork's internal controls, the document does not provide specific details about whether formal material weaknesses have been identified by auditors or management.

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

**Caveats and Limitations:**
1. This is a summary statement from the risk factors section and does not provide detailed disclosure about the nature or extent of internal control deficiencies
2. The full proxy statement/prospectus document provided appears to be truncated (ends mid-sentence on page 43)
3. More detailed discussion of internal controls may exist in sections not included in the provided excerpt, such as management's discussion and analysis or auditor reports
4. The statement acknowledges the need for development rather than confirming specific identified material weaknesses
5. As an emerging growth company, BowX/New WeWork may not yet be required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (referenced on page 18)
