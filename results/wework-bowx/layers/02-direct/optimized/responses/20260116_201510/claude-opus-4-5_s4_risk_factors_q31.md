**Citation:** Page 2 of the proxy statement/prospectus states: "The Merger Agreement provides that, immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, the New WeWork board of directors will be comprised of nine directors: Marcelo Claure, Michel Combes, Bruce Dunlevie, Véronique Laury, Sandeep Mathrani, Deven Parekh, Vivek Ranadivé, Kirthiga Reddy and Jeff Sine."

This is also confirmed in the Notice of Special Meeting section (page iv-v), which describes the Director Election Proposal as "a proposal to elect, effective at Closing, assuming the BCA Proposal and the Organizational Documents Proposals are approved, nine directors who, upon consummation of the Business Combination, will be the directors of New WeWork."

**Additional Context:**
- Vivek Ranadivé is the current Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of BowX who will continue as a director of New WeWork (page 13)
- Sandeep Mathrani is WeWork's current Chief Executive Officer (page 15)
- Marcelo Claure is WeWork's current Executive Chairman (page 16)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - This information is directly stated in the document.

**Caveats:** The document notes that this board composition is contingent upon (1) approval of the BCA Proposal and Organizational Documents Proposals, and (2) approval of the Director Election Proposal by BowX stockholders at the special meeting.
