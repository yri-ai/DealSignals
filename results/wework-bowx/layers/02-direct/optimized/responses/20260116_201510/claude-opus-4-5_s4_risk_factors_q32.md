## Voting Structure Post-Merger

Based on the proxy statement/prospectus, here is the voting structure following the Business Combination:

### Share Classes and Voting Rights

**Class A Common Stock:**
- Par value $0.0001 per share
- 1,500,000,000 shares authorized
- Standard voting rights (one vote per share)
(Page B-1, Organizational Documents Proposal A)

**Class C Common Stock:**
- Par value $0.0001 per share  
- 25,041,666 shares authorized
- Described as a "**non-economic voting security without rights to dividends or on liquidation**"
- Issued in exchange for WeWork Class C Common Stock and corresponds with outstanding WeWork Partnerships Profits Interest Units
(Pages x, xiii - Selected Definitions; Page 10 - Organizational Documents Proposal A)

### SoftBank Voting Cap

**Critical Restriction:** With respect to any vote or election submitted to stockholders, the SoftBank Holders are **restricted from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9%** of the voting securities present (in person or by proxy) and voting at any such meeting of stockholders. This restriction applies **for a period of at least two years** following the Business Combination.
(Page 10, Organizational Documents Proposal B; Page i, Notice of Special Meeting)

### Board Structure

- **Single class of directors** (no staggered board)
- Board vacancies filled by majority of directors then in office, unless specified otherwise in the Stockholders Agreement or Proposed Bylaws
- Nine directors upon consummation of the Business Combination
(Page 10, Organizational Documents Proposal C; Page ii, Director Election Proposal)

### Confidence Level: **HIGH**

This information is directly stated in the document in multiple locations.

### Caveats:
- The specific voting mechanics for Class C Common Stock beyond being "non-economic" are not fully detailed in the excerpted portions
- The exact terms of how the 49.9% SoftBank voting cap is calculated and enforced would require review of the full Proposed Charter (Annex B)
