## Lock-Up Agreements

Based on the document, here are the key details about the lock-up agreements:

### Definition and Purpose
Lock-Up Agreements are agreements entered into by the Sponsor, certain BowX officers, certain WeWork officers, and certain WeWork Stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. Under these agreements, the parties agreed not to sell or dispose of their shares for a specified period after closing.

### Key Terms
According to the document, parties to the Lock-Up Agreements agreed not to:
- **(a)** sell or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of New WeWork Common Stock held by such persons immediately after the Closing (the "Lock-Up Shares")
- **(b)** enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such Lock-Up Shares
- **(c)** publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b)

These restrictions apply "for the duration of the applicable Lock-Up Period" (Page 6-7, under "Lock-Up Agreement" section).

### Lock-Up Period
The document defines the "Lock-Up Period" as **"one year or nine months as specified in the Lock-Up Agreements"** (Page xii-xiii, Selected Definitions).

### Lock-Up Shares Definition
"Lock-Up Shares" are defined as **"any shares of New WeWork Common Stock held by the parties to the Lock-Up Agreements immediately after the Closing, or any shares of New WeWork Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options, warrants or other convertible securities held by such persons immediately after the Closing"** (Page xiii, Selected Definitions).

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - This information is directly stated in the document.

**Caveats:** The document references that the full form of Lock-Up Agreement is attached as Annex M, but the detailed terms within that annex are not included in the provided text. The specific lock-up period (one year vs. nine months) appears to vary by party as specified in the individual agreements.
