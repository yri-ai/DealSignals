## Market Context at Deal Time

Based on the document, here is the market context at the time of the BowX-WeWork merger deal:

### COVID-19 Pandemic Impact

The deal was announced on **March 25, 2021**, during a period when the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly affecting WeWork's business and the broader commercial real estate market.

**Key market conditions cited in the document:**

1. **Pandemic Disruption**: "The global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19, including variants of the virus (particularly the Delta variant), has resulted in significant disruption and has created additional risks to the Company's and its joint ventures partners' businesses, the industry and the economy." (Page 31)

2. **Membership Decline**: "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%." (Page 31)

3. **Shift in Office Space Demand**: The BowX board considered that "the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate the shift away from traditional office space" and that "flexible workspaces could potentially represent up to 22.2% of the U.S. office real-estate market by 2030." (Pages 15-16)

4. **Bad Debt Increases**: "The Company recorded $17.2 million and $67.5 million in bad debt expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to $21.0 million and $22.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019." (Pages 31-32)

5. **Excess Supply Concern**: "The Company has experienced and may continue to experience pricing challenges in the market place due to an excess supply of commercial real estate available to customers or potential customers as a result of companies deferring their return-to-office plans, as well as businesses considering remote and hybrid office space arrangements." (Page 32)

- **Initial enterprise value**: $8.8 billion (Page 16)
