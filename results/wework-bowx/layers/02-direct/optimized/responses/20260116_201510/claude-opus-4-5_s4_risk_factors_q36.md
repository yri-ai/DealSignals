## Analysis of Comparable Transactions Disclosure

Based on my review of this S-4/A proxy statement/prospectus document, **no comparable transactions were disclosed** in the traditional sense of a valuation analysis comparing this deal to similar transactions in the market.

### Evidence from the Document:

**1. No Third-Party Fairness Opinion or Valuation:**

The document explicitly states that BowX did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion:

> "No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination. The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders."
> (Page xviii, Q&A Section)

**2. Determination of Fair Market Value Without External Benchmark:**

> "The BowX board of directors also determined, without seeking a valuation from a financial advisor, that WeWork's fair market value was at least 80% of BowX's net assets, excluding any taxes payable on interest earned. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the judgment of the BowX board of directors as described above in valuing WeWork's business and assuming the risk that the BowX board of directors may not have properly valued such business."
> (Page xviii, Q&A Section)

**3. Valuation Factors Considered:**

The Board's reasons for the Business Combination (Pages 15-17) include factors such as:
- Large and growing addressable market
- Portfolio of product offerings
- Platform business opportunity
- Experienced management team
- "Attractive Initial Valuation" - stated as $8.8 billion pre-transaction enterprise value
- Results of due diligence
- PIPE Investment participation

However, **none of these factors include comparable transaction analysis** comparing this deal to other SPAC mergers, flexible workspace company acquisitions, or similar transactions.

### Confidence Level: **HIGH**

This conclusion is directly supported by explicit statements in the document that no third-party valuation or fairness opinion was obtained.

### Caveats:
- The document is extensive (the provided excerpt is partial), but the key sections regarding valuation methodology and Board deliberations do not reference comparable transactions.
- The $8.8 billion enterprise value and $6.553 billion equity value are stated without disclosed benchmarking against comparable deals.
