## Exit/Refinancing Strategy for Lease Obligations

Based on the provided document, I can identify the following information regarding WeWork's approach to managing its lease obligations:

### Real Estate Portfolio Optimization Strategy

The document describes WeWork's ongoing efforts to optimize its real estate portfolio through lease amendments and exits:

**From the Risk Factors section (pages 37-38):**
> "As part of this plan, beginning in the fall of 2019, the Company began a global review of its locations to optimize its real estate portfolio. This has resulted in strategically executing full or partial lease exits for locations with more limited prospects of profitability."

**Quantified Results (page 37):**
> "As of June 30, 2021, the Company and its joint venture partners have negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners around the world, resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments and a reduction in total lease security of approximately $1.1 Billion"

### Lease Termination Costs

**From page 38:**
> "During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred lease-related termination costs in connection with the aforementioned strategic lease terminations, substantially all being equal to or less than the security coverage of each lease."

> "The Company continues to incur such costs and the Company anticipates that there will be additional lease termination fees paid in the future, substantially all of which are expected to be equal to or less than the security coverage of each applicable lease."

### Limitations and Risks

**From pages 33-34:**
The document notes that "In addition, the Company may not be able to negotiate lower fixed monthly payments under its leases at rates which are commensurate with the rates at which the Company may agree to lower its monthly membership fees" and "At certain locations, the Company has not been able to, and may not be able to, reduce its rent under the lease or otherwise terminate the lease."

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

**Caveats:**
- The document does not describe a comprehensive "exit/refinancing strategy" in explicit strategic terms, but rather describes ongoing optimization efforts
- No specific timeline or targets for future lease exits are provided
- The document notes that the optimization process "is ongoing and there can be no assurance that these efforts will continue to be successful" (page 37-38)
- The document does not address refinancing of lease obligations specifically, only exits/amendments
