## Post-Merger Integration and Business Model Changes

Based on the provided S-4/A document, the following post-merger integration and business model changes were planned:

### Corporate Structure Changes

**Name Change and Listing Transfer:**
- BowX will change its name to "WeWork Inc." upon closing (Organizational Documents Proposal D, page 10)
- The company intends to apply to list New WeWork Class A Common Stock and warrants on NYSE under symbols "WE" and "WE WS" respectively, transferring from Nasdaq (page 1)

### Governance Structure Changes

**Board Composition:**
- New WeWork's board will be comprised of nine directors: Marcelo Claure, Michel Combes, Bruce Dunlevie, Véronique Laury, Sandeep Mathrani, Deven Parekh, Vivek Ranadivé, Kirthiga Reddy and Jeff Sine (page xxiii)

**Capital Structure:**
- Authorized capital stock will change from 87,500,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock, 12,500,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock to 1,500,000,000 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock, 25,041,666 shares of Class C Common Stock, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock (Organizational Documents Proposal A, page 10)

**SoftBank Voting Restrictions:**
- SoftBank Holders will be restricted "for a period of at least two years, from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present (in person or by proxy) and voting at any such meeting of the stockholders" (Organizational Documents Proposal B, page 10)

### Business Strategy Changes

**Strategic Focus:**
WeWork's new strategic plan emphasizes:
- "achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations"
- "focusing on optimizing the Company's existing real estate portfolio of domestic and international locations"
- "executing well on its current pipeline of locations before seeking growth opportunities" (page 37)

**Real Estate Portfolio Optimization:**
- "As of June 30, 2021, the Company and its joint venture partners have negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners around the world, resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments and a reduction in total lease security of approximately $1.1 Billion" (page 37-38)

**Platform Business Development:**
- "WeWork is currently developing a platform that would leverage its systems and established global customer base to offer landlords and operators the ability to power and manage flexible spaces in their portfolio" (page 16)

**Regional Joint Venture Model:**
- The Company intends to "pursue regional joint venture arrangements in which the Company licenses, for a fee to an operator of flexible space in a location in which WeWork does not operate, the use of the WeWork technology and services for managing and powering flexible work spaces and access to WeWork's customer base" (page 42)

### Management Continuation
- WeWork's existing management team, including CEO Sandeep Mathrani, will continue with the combined company (page 16)

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - These changes are directly stated in the document.

**Caveats:**
- The document notes that "These business models are unproven and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts" regarding the platform and joint venture strategies (page 42)
- The document indicates WeWork's "historical growth rates prior to the end of 2019 are not expected to be indicative of its future growth" (page 39)
