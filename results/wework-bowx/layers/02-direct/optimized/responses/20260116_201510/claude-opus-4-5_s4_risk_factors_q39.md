## Debt Covenants and Restrictions Analysis

Based on the provided S-4/A document, I found the following information regarding debt covenants and restrictions:

### Key Finding

The document references that WeWork's indebtedness contains restrictive covenants that affect the company's operations. Specifically:

**Page 40 (Risk Factors section):**
The document states that the terms of the Company's indebtedness "restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability to respond to changes or take certain actions, including some of which may affect completion of the Company's strategic plan."

The document also mentions that borrowing under the SoftBank Senior Secured Debt is "subject to applicable restrictive covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness."

### Debt Facilities Referenced

The document identifies the following debt arrangements with covenants (Page 3 and Selected Definitions section, pages xi-xii):

1. **Company Credit Agreement** - Credit Agreement dated December 27, 2019, as amended, among WeWork Companies LLC, SBG, Goldman Sachs International Bank as administrative agent

2. **2020 LC Facility** - With $1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit as of June 30, 2021

3. **SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt** - $2.2 billion outstanding as of June 30, 2021

4. **SoftBank Senior Secured Debt** - Up to $1.1 billion available for borrowing

### Limitation of Information

**Confidence Level: LOW**

**Caveat:** The document does not provide specific details about the actual covenant terms, financial ratio requirements, or specific operational restrictions contained in these debt agreements. The document only references that such restrictive covenants exist without enumerating them. The full covenant details would likely be found in the underlying credit agreements and note purchase agreements, which are not fully reproduced in this S-4/A filing.
