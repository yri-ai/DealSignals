# Investment Analysis: BowX Acquisition Corp. / WeWork Merger

## Executive Summary

Based on my analysis of this S-4/A filing, **I would NOT invest** in this SPAC merger. Below is my detailed reasoning with citations.

---

## Key Concerns

### 1. Significant History of Losses and Uncertain Path to Profitability

WeWork has a substantial history of losses with no clear timeline to profitability:

- **Accumulated deficit and net losses**: "$3.0 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively" (Page 35, Risk Factors section)

- The company explicitly states: "The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in accordance with GAAP)" (Page 35)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

### 2. Severe COVID-19 Impact and Uncertain Recovery

- "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships...declined 16%" (Page 31)

- "There is no guarantee that membership numbers will return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels" (Page 31)

- Bad debt expense increased significantly: "$17.2 million and $67.5 million in bad debt expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to $21.0 million and $22.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019" (Pages 31-32)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

### 3. Massive Long-Term Lease Obligations vs. Short-Term Revenue Contracts

This is a critical structural mismatch:

- "The average length of the initial term of its leases is approximately 15 years, and the average term of its membership agreements is 15 months" (Page 34)

- "As of June 30, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was **$36.6 billion**" (Page 34)

- Security packages represent "less than 20% of future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations" (Page 34)

- Committed sales contracts total only "approximately $3 billion" against $36.6 billion in obligations (Page 34)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

### 4. Significant Dilution Risk

Post-merger shareholders face substantial dilution:

- WeWork stockholders will own approximately 82.7% of the combined company (Page 8)
- Public stockholders (excluding PIPE) will own only 6.1% assuming no redemptions (Page 8)
- Additional dilution from: 16,100,000 public warrants, 7,773,333 private placement warrants, the First Warrant (39,115,176 shares), and the LC Warrant (11,917,938 shares) (Pages 7-8)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

### 5. Related Party Concerns and Governance Issues

- Significant debt owed to SoftBank entities: "$1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit...and $2.2 billion in outstanding indebtedness" (Page 40)

- SoftBank Holders' voting rights capped at 49.9% for two years, indicating governance concerns (Page 10)

- Adam Neumann retains board observer rights (Page 41)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

### 6. Unproven Transformation Strategy

- "The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management and there can be no assurances that this new business strategy will be successful" (Page 37)

- Workforce reduced "by approximately 70%" (Page 39)

**Confidence: HIGH** - directly stated

---

## Limited Positive Factors

- Large addressable market opportunity (Pages 15-16)
- $800 million PIPE investment from institutional investors (Page 3)
- Experienced new management team (Page 16)
- Portfolio optimization efforts: "over 500 lease amendments and/or exits...resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments" (Page 37)

---

## Caveats and Limitations

1. This analysis is based solely on the S-4/A filing dated September 16, 2021
2. No independent valuation opinion was obtained by BowX's board (Page xxiii)
3. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant uncertainty
4. The document explicitly warns of numerous additional risks not fully detailed

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: DO NOT INVEST**

The structural mismatch between long-term lease obligations ($36.6 billion) and short-term membership contracts (~15 months average), combined with persistent massive losses, significant dilution, COVID-19 uncertainty, and an unproven turnaround strategy make this investment too risky. The company's own risk factors state explicitly that profitability is uncertain and that the business transformation may not succeed.

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - based on directly stated financial data and risk disclosures in the filing.
