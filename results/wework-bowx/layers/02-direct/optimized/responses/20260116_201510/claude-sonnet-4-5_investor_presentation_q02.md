# Answer: Not found in document

## Analysis:

I have thoroughly reviewed the provided document, which appears to be a WeWork SPAC merger presentation from 2021. However, the document contains minimal readable financial data.

## What the document contains:
- Company values and mission statements (pages with "right thing," "better together," etc.)
- Product descriptions (All Access offering)
- A timeline chart spanning 2010-2030 (one page)
- Various bullet points with definitions of metrics and terminology
- Multiple pages marked only with "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential."

## What is missing:
- **No specific revenue figures** for any period
- **No year-over-year revenue growth rates** stated or calculable
- **No financial statements** with revenue data
- **No tables with historical or projected revenue numbers**

## Confidence: HIGH

I am highly confident that the revenue growth rate year-over-year is **not found in this document** because I can see all pages, and none contain the actual financial data needed to answer this question. While this appears to be a presentation deck for a SPAC merger, the pages with detailed financial information are either not included in this excerpt or contain only structure/headers without the actual numbers filled in.

## Recommendation:
To conduct proper due diligence on revenue growth, you would need access to:
- The financial appendix or detailed financial schedules
- Historical financial statements
- The investor presentation with complete financial projections
