# Analysis: Key Assumptions Underlying the Projections

## Finding:

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:

The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation with multiple slides, but the actual content of most slides is not visible in the transcript provided. The document shows:

- Multiple copyright headers ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet points without accompanying text (shown as "•" or "●")
- One visible section describing "All Access" product features and benefits
- One visible section describing WeWork's company values (integrity, collaboration, gratitude, etc.)
- A timeline reference showing years from 2010 to 2030
- Various section markers and formatting elements

However, the document does **not contain** specific financial projection assumptions such as:
- Revenue growth rates or drivers
- Occupancy rate assumptions
- Pricing assumptions
- Cost structure assumptions
- Market size or market share assumptions
- Member retention or churn assumptions
- Capital expenditure assumptions
- Geographic expansion plans with specific metrics

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The content that would typically contain projection assumptions (financial model details, footnotes explaining forecast methodology, assumption tables) is not visible or included in the provided document transcript.

## Caveat:

The document appears to be incomplete or the text content of most slides was not successfully extracted. A complete analysis would require access to the full, readable presentation materials.
