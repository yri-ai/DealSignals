# Answer: Not found in document

## Analysis:

I conducted a thorough review of the provided document searching for specific financial metrics related to "contribution margin per membership."

**What I found:**
- The document mentions "High Margins" in the context of the All Access subscription-based model, stating "Significant incremental margins given subscription-based model on top of traditional leased business" (page discussing All Access product)
- Multiple references to bullet points and definitions related to metrics (visible in the later pages with metric definitions)
- References to membership-related business models

**What is missing:**
- No specific numerical value for contribution margin per membership
- No formula or calculation methodology for this specific metric
- While the document appears to have detailed metric definitions in later sections (indicated by multiple bullet points on pages with "divided by" language), the actual text content of these definitions is not legible in the provided document

**Confidence: HIGH** that this specific metric is not provided in the readable portions of the document.

**Caveat:** The document appears to have multiple pages with financial metrics and definitions (particularly the pages marked with extensive bullet points near the end), but the actual text content is not visible/readable, showing only "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." headers and bullet point markers. If these sections contained the detailed metric definitions, the answer might be present but not accessible in the provided format.
