# Analysis: Revenue per Available Desk/Workstation

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

While the document appears to be a WeWork SPAC merger presentation (based on the consistent "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." markings throughout), the actual content of the slides is not visible in the provided text. The document only shows:

1. Copyright notices on each page
2. Bullet points (• and ○) without accompanying text
3. Some partial text fragments including:
   - Company values and mission statements
   - A mention of "All Access" subscription model features
   - References to metrics and definitions (indicated by bullet points and "divided by" language)
   - A timeline reference spanning 2010-2030

The document structure suggests there may be financial metrics and definitions included (as indicated by the section with multiple bullets discussing ratios and calculations), but the specific revenue per desk/workstation metric is not legible or stated in the provided text.

## Confidence Level

**N/A** - Cannot provide confidence rating as the information is not present in the readable portions of the document.

## Caveats

The document appears to be improperly extracted or converted, showing only formatting elements and copyright notices rather than the substantive content that would typically appear in a SPAC merger due diligence presentation.
