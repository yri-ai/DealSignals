# Answer: Member Churn Rate

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
While the document contains extensive content about WeWork's business model, operations, and member-related information, I could not locate any specific definition, calculation methodology, or actual figures for "member churn rate" in the provided pages.

The document does reference:
- Members and member-related topics throughout various sections
- Business metrics and definitions (appears to be in later sections based on bullet points visible)
- Subscription-based models and member access (visible in the "All Access" section)

However, none of the visible text explicitly states what the member churn rate is or provides data about churn rates.

## Confidence Level: 
**HIGH** - I am highly confident that this specific metric is not clearly stated in the visible portions of the provided document.

## Caveat:
The document appears to have many pages with content that is not fully visible or readable (showing only "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." headers). If there is a metrics definition section or appendix with full content visible, it may contain this information, but it is not discernible from what has been provided.
