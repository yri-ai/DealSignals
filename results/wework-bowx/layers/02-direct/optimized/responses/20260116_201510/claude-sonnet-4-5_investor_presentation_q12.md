# Answer: Not found in document

## Analysis:

I conducted a thorough review of the provided WeWork document searching for information about average revenue per member (ARPM or similar metrics). 

**Search Results:**
- The document contains multiple pages with "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." headers but most content is not visible or consists only of bullet points without accompanying text
- There are references to business model elements including "All Access" subscription services and "High Margins" 
- The document mentions metrics and KPIs in sections with bullet points (indicated by ● symbols) but the actual values and metric names are not legible in the provided text
- One page references "divided by" suggesting ratio calculations, but the specific metrics being calculated are not visible

**Limitations:**
The document appears to be a presentation deck where:
1. Most slide content is not captured in the text extraction
2. Financial metrics and data tables are not readable in this format
3. Charts and graphs (referenced by years 2010-2030 on one page) are not accessible

## Confidence: N/A
The specific average revenue per member figure cannot be determined from the provided document content.
