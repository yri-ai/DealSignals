# Analysis of Lease Commitment Duration Profile

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

The provided document does not contain specific information about the duration profile of WeWork's lease commitments. While the document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021 (based on the repeated copyright notices), the actual content regarding lease terms, lease maturity schedules, weighted average lease duration, or similar metrics is not visible or included in the provided text.

## What Would Be Needed

To answer this question, I would need to see sections that typically contain:
- Weighted average remaining lease term
- Lease maturity schedule by year
- Distribution of lease expirations
- Minimum lease payment obligations by period
- Information about lease terms and renewal options

## Confidence Level

**N/A** - The information is not present in the document to make any assessment.

## Limitations

The document appears to be heavily redacted or the content extraction was incomplete, showing primarily copyright notices and some general business description text (company values, product descriptions like "All Access"), but no financial or operational details about lease commitments.
