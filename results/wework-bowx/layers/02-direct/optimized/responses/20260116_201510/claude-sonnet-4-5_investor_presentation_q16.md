# Analysis: Business Performance at 70% Occupancy

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain specific information about what happens to the business at 70% occupancy levels. 

## Search Methodology

I reviewed the entire document looking for:
- Specific references to "70% occupancy"
- Breakeven occupancy thresholds
- Occupancy-related performance metrics or scenarios
- Financial implications of various occupancy levels

## Related Information Found

The document does mention occupancy in the following context:
- A section on "All Access" mentions "Drives Occupancy" and states "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections" (page with All Access section)

However, this reference does not provide specific metrics or thresholds such as 70% occupancy or explain business performance at that level.

## Confidence Rating

**N/A** - The specific information requested is not present in the document.

## Caveats

The document appears to be a presentation deck with many pages marked as confidential but without visible detailed content in the transcription provided. It's possible that occupancy threshold analysis exists in charts, graphs, or detailed sections that were not captured in the text extraction.
