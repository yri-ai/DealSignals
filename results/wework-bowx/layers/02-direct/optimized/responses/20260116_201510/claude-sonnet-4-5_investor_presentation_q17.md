# Analysis: What Happens to the Business at 50% Occupancy?

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

The provided document does not contain specific information about what happens to WeWork's business at 50% occupancy levels. 

While the document mentions occupancy in several contexts:
- References to "Drives Occupancy" as a benefit of the All Access product, noting it "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections" (page referencing All Access product features)
- General business model discussions

There is **no specific analysis, financial impact, breakeven point, or operational outcomes** tied to a 50% occupancy threshold in the document.

## Confidence Level

**HIGH** - I am highly confident this specific information is not present in the document, as I have reviewed all readable content.

## Caveats

- The document contains many pages marked "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential" without visible content details
- Some pages appear to contain bullet points or structured content that is not fully legible in the provided format
- If detailed financial modeling or sensitivity analyses exist in the document, they are not visible in the provided text
