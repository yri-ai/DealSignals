# Management's Incentives/Compensation in the Deal

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** 
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck focused on business strategy, values, products (such as "All Access" on-demand workspace), and operational metrics. I reviewed all pages thoroughly but found no information regarding:

- Management compensation structure
- Equity incentives or stock options
- Performance-based bonuses
- Retention packages
- Transaction bonuses related to the SPAC merger
- Management earnouts or vesting schedules
- Any other forms of executive compensation

**Confidence Level:** HIGH

The document does not contain management compensation details. Such information would typically be found in:
- Proxy statements (DEF 14A)
- Merger agreement documents
- SEC Form S-4 registration statements
- Executive compensation disclosure sections

**Caveat:** This appears to be a partial document focused on business operations and strategy rather than a complete transaction document that would include executive compensation details required for comprehensive SPAC merger due diligence.
