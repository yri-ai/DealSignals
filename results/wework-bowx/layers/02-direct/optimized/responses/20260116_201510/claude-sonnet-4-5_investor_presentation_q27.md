# Analysis: Material Litigation or Disputes

## Answer:
**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck focusing on:
- Company values and mission statements
- Business model descriptions (All Access product, partnerships)
- Various metrics and operational details (indicated by bullet points, though specific text is not fully visible)
- Growth projections (timeline from 2010-2030 visible on one page)

However, the document does not contain any sections or disclosures regarding:
- Litigation
- Legal proceedings
- Disputes
- Contingent liabilities
- Legal risks

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The confidence is high that this specific information is not present in the provided document, though I acknowledge that:

## Caveats:
1. **Document completeness**: This appears to be an excerpt or partial presentation. A complete SPAC merger due diligence package would typically include additional documents such as:
   - SEC Form S-4 or Form 8-K filings
   - Proxy statements
   - Definitive merger agreements
   
2. **Redacted content**: Many bullet points and specific text appear to be present but not readable in the provided version, marked only as "•" without accompanying text

3. **Standard disclosure location**: Material litigation is typically disclosed in:
   - Risk Factors sections
   - Legal Proceedings sections
   - Notes to Financial Statements
   - None of these sections are visible in this presentation

## Recommendation:
Request additional due diligence documents, particularly SEC filings and the definitive merger agreement, which would contain required litigation disclosures.
