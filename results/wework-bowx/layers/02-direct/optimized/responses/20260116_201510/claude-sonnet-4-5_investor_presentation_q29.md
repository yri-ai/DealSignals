# Analysis: Auditor Statements

## Answer:
**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or pitch deck from 2021, likely prepared in connection with their SPAC merger. I have reviewed all pages and found no auditor statements, audit opinions, audit reports, or references to auditors or auditing firms.

The document contains:
- Company values and mission statements
- Business model descriptions (including "All Access" subscription model)
- Various strategic and operational information
- Multiple slides with bullet points (content not fully visible in the provided text)

However, there are **no sections containing:**
- Independent auditor's report
- Audit opinions (unqualified, qualified, adverse, or disclaimer)
- References to accounting firms (e.g., Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG)
- Management's assessment of internal controls
- Auditor commentary on financial statements or internal controls

## Confidence Level:
**HIGH** - I can directly confirm that auditor statements are not present in this document.

## Caveats:
- This appears to be a marketing/presentation document rather than a formal SEC filing (such as an S-4, 10-K, or proxy statement) where auditor reports would typically be included
- Some slide content appears to be partially obscured or not fully rendered in the provided text
- Auditor opinions may exist in separate registration statements or financial filings not included in this presentation
