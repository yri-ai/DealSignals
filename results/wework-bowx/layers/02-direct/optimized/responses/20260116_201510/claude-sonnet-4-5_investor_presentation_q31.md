# Board Composition Post-Merger

**Answer: Not found in document.**

**Confidence: HIGH**

**Explanation:**
I conducted a thorough review of the provided WeWork SPAC merger document, examining all pages for information regarding board composition, board members, directors, governance structure, or any related terms following the merger.

The document appears to be a confidential presentation that includes:
- WeWork's values and mission
- Business model information (including "All Access" subscription details)
- Various operational and strategic content
- Bullet points with redacted or non-visible content

However, there is no specific information about:
- Number of board seats
- Names of board members or directors
- Board structure or composition
- Governance arrangements post-merger
- Director nomination rights
- Board committees

**Caveat:** The document contains numerous pages with bullets and content that are not visible in the provided version (showing only "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." headers). It is possible that board composition information exists in sections that are not readable in this format, but based on the visible content, this information cannot be confirmed or cited.
