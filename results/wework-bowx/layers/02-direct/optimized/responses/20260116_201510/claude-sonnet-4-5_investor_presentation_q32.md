# Analysis of Voting Structure Post-Merger

## Answer:
**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation focused on business operations, strategy, values, and product offerings (such as "All Access" membership). While it contains multiple pages discussing WeWork's business model, partnerships, and operational metrics, there is no information about:

- Voting rights or share classes
- Governance structure post-merger
- SPAC merger terms related to voting
- Stockholder voting arrangements
- Board composition or voting controls

## Confidence Level:
**HIGH** - I have reviewed the entire document and can confirm that voting structure information is not present.

## Caveats:
- This appears to be an operational/business overview presentation rather than a merger proxy statement or definitive agreement document
- Voting structure information would typically be found in:
  - SEC Form S-4 (Registration Statement)
  - Proxy Statement/Prospectus
  - Merger Agreement
  - Certificate of Incorporation amendments
  
The document provided does not appear to be any of these regulatory or legal filings where voting structure would normally be disclosed.
