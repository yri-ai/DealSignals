  "content": "# Answer: Lock-up Agreements\n\n**Not found in document.**\n\n## Explanation:\nThe provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation focused on business strategy, values, product offerings (like All Access), and financial metrics. I have thoroughly reviewed all pages, and there is no mention of:\n- Lock-up agreements\n- Lock-up periods\n- Share transfer restrictions\n- SPAC merger lock-up terms\n- Any provisions restricting insiders or sponsors from selling shares post-merger\n\n## Confidence Level: **HIGH**\n\nThe absence of this information is definitive based on the content provided. Lock-up agreements are typically found in:\n- Merger agreements or definitive proxy statements\n- Registration statements (S-4 forms)\n- Separate lock-up agreement exhibits\n\nThis presentation appears to be a business overview deck rather than a legal/merger document that would contain lock-up provisions.\n\n## Recommendation:\nTo find lock-up agreement details, you would need to review:\n1. The definitive merger agreement (DA)\n2. SEC Form S-4 or proxy statement\n3. Form 8-K filings announcing the SPAC transaction\n4. Investor rights agreements or registration rights agreements",
