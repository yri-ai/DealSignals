# Answer: Lock-up Agreements

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation focused on business strategy, values, product offerings (like All Access), and financial metrics. I have thoroughly reviewed all pages, and there is no mention of:
- Lock-up agreements
- Lock-up periods
- Share transfer restrictions
- SPAC merger lock-up terms
- Any provisions restricting insiders or sponsors from selling shares post-merger

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The absence of this information is definitive based on the content provided. Lock-up agreements are typically found in:
- Merger agreements or definitive proxy statements
- Registration statements (S-4 forms)
- Separate lock-up agreement exhibits

This presentation appears to be a business overview deck rather than a legal/merger document that would contain lock-up provisions.

## Recommendation:
To find lock-up agreement details, you would need to review:
1. The definitive merger agreement (DA)
2. SEC Form S-4 or proxy statement
3. Form 8-K filings announcing the SPAC transaction
4. Investor rights agreements or registration rights agreements
