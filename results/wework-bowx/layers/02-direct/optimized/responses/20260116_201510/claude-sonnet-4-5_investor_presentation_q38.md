# Post-Merger Integration and Business Model Changes

Based on my analysis of the provided document, I must report:

**Not found in document.**

## Analysis:

The document provided appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021, likely related to their SPAC merger process. However, the content is heavily redacted or consists primarily of header/footer copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") with limited substantive text visible.

## What IS Visible:

The few readable sections include:
- **Company values and culture statements** (page references not numbered in document)
- **All Access product description** - describing a pay-as-you-go/subscription model for workspace access that "Drives Occupancy" and provides "High Margins"
- **Brief bullet points** (content not visible)
- **Timeline chart** spanning 2010-2030 (content not visible)

## What is NOT Found:

The document does not contain visible information about:
- Specific post-merger integration plans
- Organizational restructuring
- System integration strategies
- Synergy targets
- Management changes
- Operational consolidation plans
- Strategic business model pivots related to the merger

**Confidence: HIGH** (that this specific information is not present in the provided document)

**Caveat:** The document appears incomplete or heavily redacted, with most slide content not visible. A complete presentation deck would likely contain this information.
