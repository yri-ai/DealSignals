Based on the financial information provided in the document:

**Revenue declined year-over-year from 2019 to 2020.**

According to the Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (page 23):
- Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019: $3,458,592 thousand
- Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020: $3,415,865 thousand

**Calculation:**
Year-over-year revenue growth rate = ((3,415,865 - 3,458,592) / 3,458,592) × 100 = **-1.2%**

This represents a revenue decline of approximately 1.2% from 2019 to 2020.

**Additional context:** The document attributes this revenue decline to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. As stated on page 31-32: "The Company experienced a reduction in new sales volume at its locations, which negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the Company's results of operations" and "between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%."

**Confidence: HIGH** - This is directly calculated from audited financial statements presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Data.
