The document does not provide a specific "cash burn rate" metric. However, I can provide information about the Company's cash flows:

According to the **Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data** on page 24:

**For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021:**
- Net cash used in operating activities: $(1,158,957) thousand (approximately $1.16 billion)
- Net cash used in investing activities: $(186,628) thousand (approximately $187 million)

This means the Company used approximately **$1.35 billion in total cash** from operations and investing activities during the first half of 2021.

**For the Year Ended December 31, 2020:**
- Net cash used in operating activities: $(857,008) thousand (approximately $857 million)
- Net cash used in investing activities: $(444,087) thousand (approximately $444 million)

This totaled approximately **$1.3 billion in cash used** for the full year 2020.

**Confidence: HIGH** - These figures are directly stated in the financial statements.

**Caveat:** While these cash flow figures indicate the rate at which the company was consuming cash, the document does not provide a specific forward-looking "cash burn rate" projection. The actual figures represent historical cash usage and may not be indicative of future burn rates, especially given the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and the impact of COVID-19 on operations (pages 31-33).
