Based on the document, I cannot provide a precise cash runway calculation at current burn rate.

**Not found in document**: The document does not contain a specific analysis or calculation of cash runway at the current burn rate.

However, I can provide relevant financial information that would inform this analysis:

**Relevant Financial Data:**

1. **Cash Position (as of June 30, 2021):**
   - Total cash: $506.3 million (page 22)
   - Cash and cash equivalents for consolidated VIEs: $102.6 million (page 24)

2. **Operating Cash Flow:**
   - Six months ended June 30, 2021: Negative $1,158.9 million used in operating activities (page 24)
   - Year ended December 31, 2020: Negative $857.0 million used in operating activities (page 24)

3. **Free Cash Flow:**
   - Six months ended June 30, 2021: Negative $1,312.1 million (page 25)
   - Year ended December 31, 2020: Negative $2,298.2 million (page 25)

**Minimum Cash Condition:**
The Merger Agreement requires that "the Trust Amount plus the PIPE Investment is at least equal to $800.0 million" (page 27), suggesting this is the minimum cash threshold required for operations.

**Confidence: MEDIUM** - The document provides the underlying financial metrics but does not explicitly calculate or state the cash runway.
