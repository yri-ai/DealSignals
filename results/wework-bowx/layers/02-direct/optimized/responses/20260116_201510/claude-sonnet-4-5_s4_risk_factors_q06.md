Based on the document, there is no specific path to profitability or definitive timeline stated. However, the following relevant information is provided:

**Current Status:**
"The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in accordance with GAAP)." (Page 35)

**Strategic Direction:**
"The Company's new strategic plan emphasizes achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations, focusing on optimizing the Company's existing real estate portfolio of domestic and international locations and executing well on its current pipeline of locations before seeking growth opportunities." (Page 37)

**No Specific Timeline:**
The document does not provide a specific timeline for when the company expects to achieve profitability. Instead, it notes:
"While the Company has initiated and substantially completed a strategic restructuring with the goal of creating a leaner, more efficient organization to support its long-term goal of sustainable growth, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in realizing the benefits of this plan." (Page 35)

**Confidence: HIGH** - The document explicitly discusses profitability challenges and strategic plans but does not contain a specific path or timeline to profitability.

**Caveats:** The company has significant accumulated deficits and net losses, and explicitly states uncertainty about achieving profitability, though they are pursuing positive Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) through various operational improvements.
