The document does not contain detailed projections or their underlying assumptions.

**Confidence: HIGH (directly stated)**

**Explanation:** While this proxy statement/prospectus contains extensive information about the Business Combination between BowX Acquisition Corp. and WeWork Inc., including historical financial information, pro forma financial information, and various business metrics, it does not include forward-looking financial projections or forecasts with their underlying assumptions.

The document states that it contains "forward-looking statements" regarding various matters (page xxxv), but these are general statements about expectations, beliefs, and intentions rather than detailed financial projections with specific assumptions.

**Caveat:** The absence of detailed projections in this document is typical for SPAC merger proxy statements, which generally focus on historical financial performance and the structure of the transaction rather than management projections.
