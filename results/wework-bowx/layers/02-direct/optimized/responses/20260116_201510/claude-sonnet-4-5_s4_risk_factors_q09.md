Not found in document.

The document does not provide a specific metric or calculation for "revenue per available desk/workstation" or "revenue per workstation." While the document mentions various financial metrics and operational statistics, including:

- Total revenue figures for different periods
- Membership counts
- Workstation capacity and occupancy metrics
- Physical Occupancy (defined as "the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations")

There is no explicit disclosure of revenue per available desk or workstation in the sections I reviewed.

Confidence: HIGH (based on thorough review of financial sections and defined metrics)
