Based on the information provided in the document, I cannot find a specific member churn rate reported.

**NOT FOUND IN DOCUMENT**

The document discusses churn in several places:

- Page 42 mentions: "The Company had also been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by member churn, non-payment (or delayed payment) from members or members seeking payment concessions or deferrals or cancellations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."

- Page 43 states: "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, higher levels of membership agreement terminations. Specifically, between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%."

While the document indicates there was a 16% decline in total memberships over a one-year period and discusses churn as a risk factor, it does not provide a specific churn rate metric (i.e., the percentage of members who cancel their memberships per month or year).

**CONFIDENCE: HIGH** - The document thoroughly discusses membership trends and risks but does not contain a specific churn rate figure.
