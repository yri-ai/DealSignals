Based on the document, I can provide information about WeWork's lease obligations:

**Total Undiscounted Minimum Lease Payment Obligations:**
As of June 30, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was **$36.6 billion** (page 32).

**Future Committed Revenue:**
The document also notes that "committed sales contracts to be recognized as revenue in the future totaled approximately **$3 billion**" as of June 30, 2021 (page 32).

**Security Packages:**
Notably, "as of June 30, 2021, the total security packages, including in the form of corporate guarantees, outstanding letters of credit, cash security deposits to landlords and surety bonds issued, provided by the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of those lease obligations was approximately **$6.5 billion**, representing less than 20% of future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations" (page 32).

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (directly stated)

**Caveat:** The document emphasizes that these are *undiscounted* minimum lease cost payment obligations, and the actual present value would be lower when discounted to present value terms.
