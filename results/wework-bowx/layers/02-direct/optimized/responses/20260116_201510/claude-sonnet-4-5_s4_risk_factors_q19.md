Based on the provided document, there is **no specific valuation methodology detailed** to justify the $6.553 billion pre-transaction equity value of WeWork. The document explicitly states:

**"BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider, and consequently, you have no assurance from an independent source that the Business Combination is fair to BowX from a financial point of view."** (Risk Factors section, page not specifically cited but found in summary)

Additionally, the document notes:

**"No. The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination."** (Questions and Answers section)

The board stated: **"The BowX board of directors believes that based upon the financial skills and background of its directors, it was qualified to conclude that the Business Combination was fair from a financial perspective to its stockholders. The BowX board of directors also determined, without seeking a valuation from a financial advisor, that WeWork's fair market value was at least 80% of BowX's net assets, excluding any taxes payable on interest earned."** (Questions and Answers section)

The valuation appears to be based on:
- The agreed Aggregate Merger Consideration of **655,300,000 shares at a deemed value of $10.00 per share**
- Internal assessment by BowX's board of directors without external validation

**Confidence: HIGH** - This is directly stated in the document.

**Caveat**: The absence of independent valuation or fairness opinion is explicitly disclosed as a risk factor to investors.
