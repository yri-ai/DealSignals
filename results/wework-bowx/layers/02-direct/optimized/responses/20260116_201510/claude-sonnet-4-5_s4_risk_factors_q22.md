Based on the document, SoftBank has several significant roles and ongoing obligations:

## Financial Commitments and Debt Facilities

**Outstanding Debt**: As of June 30, 2021, SoftBank Group Corp. (SBG) had substantial financial exposure to WeWork, including:
- $1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2020 LC Facility
- $2.2 billion in outstanding indebtedness under the SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt
- The ability to provide up to $1.1 billion under the SoftBank Senior Secured Debt (subject to restrictive covenants)

**Letter of Credit Facility Extension**: Through the Credit Support Letter Agreement dated March 25, 2021, "the SoftBank Obligor commits to consent to an extension of the termination date of the 2020 LC Facility from February 10, 2023, to no later than February 10, 2024" (Page 38).

**Senior Secured Notes**: Under the Commitment Letter, "WeWork Companies LLC, WW Co-Obligor Inc. and the Note Purchaser agreed to amend the terms of the senior secured purchase agreement, to provide for up to $550 million of 7.50% senior secured notes to be issued by WeWork Companies LLC and purchased by the Note Purchaser" (Page 38). These notes "will mature on the earlier to occur of: (a) 18 months from the date of the Closing; or (b) February 12, 2023" (Page 38).

## Warrants and Equity Participation

**First Warrant**: "BowX will issue to SBWW or its designees the First Warrant to purchase a number of shares of BowX Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to 47,366,404 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio" at "$0.01 divided by the Exchange Ratio" (Page 7). At the Exchange Ratio, "the First Warrant will enable SBWW to purchase 39,115,176 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock" with "an estimated fair value of approximately $391.2 million" (Pages 7-8).

**LC Warrant**: Contingent upon the LC Facility Termination Extension, "BowX will issue to the SoftBank Obligor or its designees the LC Warrant to purchase a number of shares of BowX Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to 14,431,991 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio" (Page 8). This would "enable Softbank Obligor to purchase 11,917,938 shares of New WeWork Class A Common Stock" with "an estimated fair value of approximately $119.2 million" (Page 8).

## Voting and Governance Rights

**Voting Restrictions**: Under Organizational Documents Proposal B, "to restrict the SoftBank Holders, for a period of at least two years, from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present (attending virtually or by proxy) and voting at any such meeting of the stockholders" (Page 10).

**Expected Ownership**: SBWW is described as "WeWork's largest stockholder" (Page 5) and "is expected to be a substantial stockholder of New WeWork and will have substantial influence of matters of corporate governance for New WeWork" (Page 40).

## Related Party Considerations
