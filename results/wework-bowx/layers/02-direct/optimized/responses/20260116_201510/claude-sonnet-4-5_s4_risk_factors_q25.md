## Board Observer Rights
Starting February 26, 2022, Mr. Neumann (or a designee subject to SBG's approval) has the right to observe meetings of New WeWork's board of directors and certain committees in a non-voting observer capacity. He is entitled to copies of written materials provided to directors, subject to certain conditions. These observer rights terminate when he ceases to beneficially own equity securities of WeWork representing at least 19,028,251 shares of WeWork Class A Common Stock (on an as-converted basis).

In 2020, the Company paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications (outside of amounts covered by insurance), and may be required to pay more in the future.
