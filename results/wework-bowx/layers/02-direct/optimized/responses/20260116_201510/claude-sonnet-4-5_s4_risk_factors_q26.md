Based on the document, the top disclosed risk factors for the WeWork SPAC merger are:

**1. COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**
"The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and recovery from the pandemic may take longer than anticipated" (page 31). The document notes that "between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%" (pages 31-32).

**2. Member Retention and Acquisition**
"The Company may not be able to continue to retain existing members, many of whom enter into membership agreements with short-term commitments, or to attract new members in sufficient numbers or at sufficient rates to sustain and increase its memberships or at all" (page 32). The document highlights that "approximately 10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments" during the six months ended June 30, 2021 (page 33).

**3. History of Losses**
"The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability (as determined in accordance with GAAP)" (page 35). The document states: "The Company had an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2021, December 31, 2020 and 2019 and had net losses of $3.0 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively" (page 35).

**4. Lease Obligations**
"The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company's leases may limit the Company's operating flexibility and could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations" (page 33). The document notes that "as of June 30, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was $36.6 billion" while "committed sales contracts to be recognized as revenue in the future totaled approximately $3 billion" (pages 33-34).

**5. Execution of Business Transformation**
"The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management and there can be no assurances that this new business strategy will be successful" (page 37).

**Confidence: HIGH** - These risk factors are explicitly stated and prominently featured in the Risk Factors section beginning on page 31.
