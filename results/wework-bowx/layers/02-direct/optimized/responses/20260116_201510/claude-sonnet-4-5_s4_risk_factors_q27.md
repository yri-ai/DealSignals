In a small number of cases, the Company's real estate portfolio optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords." (page discussing lease obligations)

**Indemnification-Related Matters:**
- "The Company has agreed to indemnify certain of its current and former directors and executive officers and shareholders under the WeWork Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and various other agreements. The Company has agreed to reimburse indemnified parties for certain legal expenses incurred and, in 2020, paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications, outside of the amounts covered by insurance." (Risk Factors section)

**2019 IPO-Related Matters:**
- The document mentions "significant legal costs incurred by WeWork in connection with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork's 2019 withdrawn initial public offering and the related execution of the SoftBank Transactions, net of any insurance or other recoveries" (Selected Definitions section, Adjusted EBITDA definition)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - The document explicitly mentions these legal matters but does not provide extensive detail about specific cases, amounts at stake, or potential outcomes beyond the $14 million in indemnification payments made in 2020.
