Based on my review of the provided S-4/A document, I did not find any explicit going concern disclosures from the auditors.

**Finding: Not found in document**

**Confidence: HIGH (based on thorough review of available content)**

**Caveats:**
- The document does contain extensive risk factors and discussion of WeWork's history of losses and liquidity challenges (pages 31-44)
- The document mentions WeWork had an accumulated deficit and net losses of $3.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.9 billion for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively (page 35)
- The document references that WeWork's accumulated deficit and net losses resulted from substantial investments and COVID-19 impacts (page 35)
- However, I did not locate a specific "going concern" opinion or qualification from auditors in the sections I could review

**Note:** While the full audited financial statements and audit opinions are referenced as being included elsewhere in the proxy statement/prospectus (noted as "F-1" index), those specific pages containing the actual audit reports were not provided in the excerpt I reviewed. A complete going concern assessment would require reviewing the actual audit opinion letters within those financial statement sections.
