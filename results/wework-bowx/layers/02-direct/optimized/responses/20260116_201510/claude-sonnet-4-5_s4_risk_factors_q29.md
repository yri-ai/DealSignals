Based on the provided document, I cannot find specific statements from the auditors regarding their audit opinion.

**CONFIDENCE: LOW (inferred)**

**CAVEATS:**

The document references audited financial statements multiple times (see page 21: "The selected historical condensed statements of operations data of BowX for the period from May 19, 2020, (date of inception) to December 31, 2020, and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2020, are derived from BowX's restated audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus"). However, the actual auditor's report with their opinion is not included in the portion of the document provided.

The document notes on page 21 that "The restatement is more fully described in Note 2 to the notes to BowX's financial statements included herein," suggesting there was a restatement requiring auditor involvement, but the specific auditor commentary is not present in these excerpts.

To provide complete information about what the auditors said, I would need access to the full audited financial statements section referenced as being "included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus."
