Based on the document, yes, there are references to material weaknesses in internal controls.

**Relevant Statement:**

The document states: "WeWork's internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company and a company of its global scale." (page 19, Risk Factors section)

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (derived/inferred rather than explicitly detailed)

**Caveats:**
1. The document mentions that internal controls need "further development" but does not explicitly enumerate specific material weaknesses
2. The statement appears in the risk factors section as a forward-looking concern rather than as a detailed disclosure of identified material weaknesses
3. The document does not provide the detailed analysis of internal control deficiencies that would typically be found in a comprehensive management assessment or auditor's report on internal controls
4. No specific remediation plans or timelines for addressing these control issues are provided in the cited section

The statement indicates that WeWork's internal controls require improvement, particularly given its transition to becoming a public company and its global scale, but specific details about the nature and severity of any material weaknesses are not elaborated in the sections reviewed.
