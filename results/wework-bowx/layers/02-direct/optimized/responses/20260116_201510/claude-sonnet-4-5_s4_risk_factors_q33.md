## Overview and Definition

According to the document, **Lock-Up Agreements are contractual arrangements where certain parties agree not to sell or dispose of their shares of New WeWork Common Stock for a specified period after the Business Combination closing** (page 5-6).

## Key Parties Subject to Lock-Up

- The Sponsor
- Certain of BowX's officers
- Certain of WeWork's officers and stockholders

(Page 5)

## Lock-Up Restrictions

The Lock-Up Agreements prohibit the following actions for the duration of the Lock-Up Period:

1. **"(a) sell or otherwise dispose of, or agree to sell or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of New WeWork Common Stock held by such persons immediately after the Closing (the 'Lock-Up Shares')"**

2. **"(b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such Lock-Up Shares"**

3. **"(c) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b)"**

(Page 6-7)

## Lock-Up Period
