Based on my review of the document, **Not found in document**.

**Confidence: HIGH** (directly searched for)

**Explanation:**
I conducted a thorough search of this S-4/A registration statement for any mention of comparable transactions or comparable company analyses. The document does not contain:

1. Any section discussing comparable transactions or precedent transactions
2. Any valuation multiples from comparable companies or deals
3. Any fairness opinion that would typically include such analysis
4. Any comparable transaction analysis in the risk factors or business combination sections

The document does explicitly state on page 103:

> "**Did the board of directors of BowX obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the Business Combination?**
> 
> **No.** The BowX board of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve the Business Combination."

Since no third-party valuation or fairness opinion was obtained, there would be no comparable transactions analysis included as part of such a valuation. The board relied on its own judgment regarding the fairness and value of the transaction rather than engaging financial advisors who would typically provide comparable transaction analyses.
