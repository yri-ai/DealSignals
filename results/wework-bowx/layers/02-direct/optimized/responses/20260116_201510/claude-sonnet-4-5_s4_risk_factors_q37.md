Based on the document, the Company's strategies for addressing its lease obligations include:

## Portfolio Optimization and Lease Restructuring

The Company has been actively negotiating lease amendments and exits to reduce its future obligations. According to the document:

**"As of June 30, 2021, the Company and its joint venture partners have negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits with landlord partners around the world, resulting in an approximately $6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments and a reduction in total lease security of approximately $1.1 Billion"** (page 37-38).

## Lease Termination Approach

The Company's exit strategy involves strategic terminations with controlled costs:

**"During the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred lease-related termination costs in connection with the aforementioned strategic lease terminations, substantially all being equal to or less than the security coverage of each lease. The Company continues to incur such costs and the Company anticipates that there will be additional lease termination fees paid in the future, substantially all of which are expected to be equal to or less than the security coverage of each applicable lease"** (page 38).

## Member Relocation

When exiting leases, the Company attempts to relocate members to nearby locations, though this presents some risk:

**"As of June 30, 2021, the Company has retained approximately 90% of relocated members but there can be no assurance this relocation retention pattern will continue"** (page 38).
