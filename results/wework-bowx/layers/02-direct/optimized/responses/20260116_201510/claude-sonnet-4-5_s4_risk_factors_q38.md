Based on the document, several post-merger integration and business model changes were planned:

**Organizational Structure Changes:**
- BowX intends to change its name to WeWork Inc. upon closing (page 2)
- The Proposed Charter would change BowX's name from "BowX Acquisition Corp." to "WeWork Inc." (Organizational Documents Proposal D, page 10)

**Capital Structure Changes:**
- Authorization to change capital stock from 87,500,000 shares of BowX Class A Common Stock, 12,500,000 shares of BowX Class B Common Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 25,041,666 shares of Class C common stock, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock (Organizational Documents Proposal A, page 10)

**Governance Changes:**
- SoftBank Holders would be restricted "for a period of at least two years, from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present (attending virtually or by proxy) and voting at any such meeting of the stockholders" (Organizational Documents Proposal B, page 10)
- Board structure changes to "provide for only one class of board of directors" (Organizational Documents Proposal C, page 10)

**Management and Board:**
- "Immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, the New WeWork board of directors will be comprised of nine directors: Marcelo Claure, Michel Combes, Bruce Dunlevie, Véronique Laury, Sandeep Mathrani, Deven Parekh, Vivek Ranadivé, Kirthiga Reddy and Jeff Sine" (page 15)

**Stock Exchange Listing:**
- "BowX intends to apply to continue the listing of New WeWork Class A Common Stock and warrants on the NYSE under the symbols 'WE' and 'WE WS,' respectively, upon the Closing" (page 2)

**Strategic Business Direction:**
The document references WeWork's ongoing transformation but does not detail specific operational changes planned post-merger beyond noting that "WeWork has refocused on its core business model and applied a disciplined approach to costs" under new leadership (page 16).

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - These details are directly stated in the merger agreement and proposal descriptions throughout the document.
