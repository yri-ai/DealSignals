Based on the proxy statement/prospectus, here are the debt covenants and restrictions that existed:

## Debt Financing Terms and Restrictions

**SoftBank Credit Facilities:**
The document states that WeWork had significant indebtedness owed to SoftBank Obligor, including:
- "$1.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2020 LC Facility"
- "$2.2 billion in outstanding indebtedness under the SoftBank Senior Unsecured Debt"
- "the ability to borrow up to $1.1 billion under the SoftBank Senior Secured Debt (defined below) subject to applicable restrictive covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness" (page 40)

**Operational Restrictions:**
The document explicitly references that "The terms of the Company's indebtedness restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability to respond to changes or take certain actions, including some of which may affect completion of the Company's strategic plan" (page 40)

**Minimum Cash Requirement:**
The Merger Agreement included a condition that "at the closing, BowX will have a minimum of $800 million in cash comprising (i) the amount of cash available in the trust account immediately prior to closing, after deducting the amount required to satisfy the share redemption amount (but prior to payment of any (a) deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and (b) any transaction expenses of WeWork and BowX), and (ii) the PIPE investment amount received by BowX prior to or substantially concurrently with the closing" (pages 26-27)

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - While the document confirms existence of restrictive covenants and debt agreements with SoftBank, the specific covenant terms are not detailed in the provided sections.
