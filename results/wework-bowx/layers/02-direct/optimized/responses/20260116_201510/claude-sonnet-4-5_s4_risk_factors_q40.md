Based on the information provided in this S-4/A filing, I would **not recommend investing** at this time. Here are the key concerns:

## Major Financial Risks

**1. Significant Operating Losses**
- "The Company had an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2021, December 31, 2020 and 2019 and had net losses of $3.0 billion, $3.8 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively" (page 35).
- There is no clear path to profitability demonstrated in the filing.

**2. Massive Lease Obligations vs. Revenue**
- "As of June 30, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries' future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases was $36.6 billion and committed sales contracts to be recognized as revenue in the future totaled approximately $3 billion" (pages 31-32).
- This represents a dangerous mismatch where long-term lease obligations are **12x higher** than committed future revenue.

**3. COVID-19 Impact**
- "Between the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Company's total memberships, including ChinaCo, IndiaCo and Israel locations, declined 16%" (pages 31-32).
- Significant bad debt expense increased: "$17.2 million and $67.5 million in bad debt expense during the six months ended June 30, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, compared to $21.0 million and $22.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019" (page 32).

## Structural Concerns

**4. Short-term Revenue vs. Long-term Obligations**
- "The average length of the initial term of its leases is approximately 15 years, and the average term of its membership agreements is 15 months" (page 34).
- "During the six months ended June 30, 2021, on average, approximately 10% of physical memberships were month-to-month commitments and could be terminated in a given month" (page 33).

**5. Valuation Concerns**
- Pre-transaction equity value of approximately $6.553 billion (page 2), down significantly from the $47 billion valuation in early 2019.
- Pro forma net loss per share of $(4.17) to $(4.44) depending on redemption scenario (page 28).

**6. Lack of Independent Valuation**
- "BowX is not obtaining an opinion from an independent valuation provider, and consequently, you have no assurance from an independent source that the Business Combination is fair to BowX from a financial point of view" (page 20).

## Recommendation

**CONFIDENCE: HIGH** - The financial data is directly stated in the filing.

**CAVEATS**: 
1. This analysis is based solely on historical data through June 30, 2021
2. Management's turnaround plan may succeed, but there is insufficient evidence of progress
3. The flexible workspace market may grow as stated, but WeWork's ability to capture that growth profitably is unproven
4. Investors with high risk tolerance and long time horizons may view this differently

The fundamental issue is that WeWork has enormous fixed obligations ($36.6B in lease payments) against volatile, short-term revenue streams ($3B committed), combined with ongoing significant losses and no clear path to profitability demonstrated in this filing.
