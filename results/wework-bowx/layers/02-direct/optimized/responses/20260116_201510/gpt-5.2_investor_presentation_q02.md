**Revenue growth rate (year-over-year):** Not found in document.

**Citations:** The provided document text contains no revenue figures by year and no explicit year-over-year revenue growth rate disclosure (document pages are not numbered in the excerpt; across the excerpted content, including the “All Access” section, there are no financial tables/figures with revenue or YoY growth).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of the required data in the provided excerpt)

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The excerpt appears incomplete and heavily redacted (many slides show only bullet placeholders “•” / “●”), and there are no visible page numbers. As a result, any revenue YoY growth rate cannot be computed or verified from the provided text alone.
