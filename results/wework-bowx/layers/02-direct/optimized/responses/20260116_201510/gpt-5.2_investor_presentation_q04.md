**Cash burn rate:** Not found in document. **(No page numbers or section headers provided in the excerpt that state cash burn, net cash used in operations, free cash flow burn, or monthly/quarterly cash burn.)**

**Confidence:** LOW (information not present)

**Caveats / limitations:** The provided document content appears to be an incomplete slide extract with many redacted/bulleted sections and no visible cash flow statement, liquidity bridge, or “cash burn” metric. Without explicit cash burn figures (or enough financial data to calculate it), a burn rate cannot be determined from this document.
