**Path to profitability and timeline stated:** **Not found in document.**  

- The provided pages are largely confidentiality footers and partially redacted/bulleted slides. The only legible business content describes “All Access” (on-demand/monthly subscription) and claims “High Margins” from “significant incremental margins given subscription-based model on top of traditional leased business,” but it **does not state a profitability path (e.g., specific actions/milestones) or a timeline/date/quarter for achieving profitability** (section header: **“All Access”**).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document excerpt provided does not contain any explicit profitability timeline or path statement).  

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The document appears incomplete and heavily redacted (many slides show only bullets without content), so a profitability path/timeline may exist in missing pages or redacted sections (**multiple slides with only “•” bullets; no page numbers visible**).
