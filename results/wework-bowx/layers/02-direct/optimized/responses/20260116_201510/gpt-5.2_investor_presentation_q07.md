Not found in document.

**Support / citations:** The provided excerpt does not include any projection tables, forecast schedules, or an assumptions section. Most pages are blank/placeholder (“© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.”) and where text exists it is high-level narrative (e.g., the “All Access” slide describing a subscription product’s intended benefits such as “Drives Occupancy” and “High Margins”) but **does not state the underlying forecast assumptions** (e.g., revenue growth rates, occupancy/utilization assumptions, pricing, member churn, location openings/closures, lease cost inflation, capex, macro assumptions, etc.). (Slide/section header: **“All Access”**)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears incomplete or heavily redacted in the provided text (many bullets without content), so projection assumptions may exist in the full deck but are not present here.

**Confidence:** HIGH (the assumptions are not provided in the excerpt).
