**Contribution margin per membership:** **Not found in document.**  

- The provided pages are largely redacted/bulleted without numerical values, and there is no explicit metric or calculation shown for “contribution margin per membership” (see the “All Access” slide describing “High Margins” but providing no per-membership contribution margin figure). **Section header: “All Access” (“High Margins…”)**.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the metric/value is not stated anywhere in the provided text).  

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- Many slides contain only bullets or are partially/fully redacted (e.g., pages with only “●” placeholders), which may omit the underlying financial definitions or figures needed to compute contribution margin per membership.
