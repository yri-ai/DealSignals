**Revenue per available desk/workstation:** **Not found in document.**  

- The provided excerpts do not include any metric, definition, or calculation for “revenue per available desk/workstation,” nor any underlying inputs (e.g., total revenue and total available desks/workstations) needed to derive it. (Document excerpt contains mostly confidentiality pages, values statements, and an “All Access” description without numerical revenue/desk figures.)

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly not present)  
**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears incomplete/redacted (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so the metric may exist in omitted sections but is not available in the provided text.
