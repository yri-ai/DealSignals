## Occupancy rate — definition
**Not found in document.** The provided pages do not include a definition of “occupancy rate” (e.g., occupied desks/available capacity, revenue occupancy, etc.). The only related statement is that **All Access “drives occupancy… beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections”** (section titled **“All Access”**), but it does not define the metric or formula.

## Occupancy rate — trend over time
**Not found in document.** No numeric occupancy rate figures (historical or projected) or an explicit occupancy trend chart is visible in the provided excerpt. The only time-axis content shown is a standalone timeline (**“2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030”**) without occupancy data attached, and the “All Access” slide contains qualitative claims only (section titled **“All Access”**).

### Confidence
**LOW** — the excerpt contains only qualitative references to “occupancy” and no definition or time-series data.

### Caveats / limitations
- The document appears **heavily redacted or incomplete** (many pages show only bullet placeholders “• / ●”), which likely omits the occupancy definition and figures.  
- Because no metric definition is provided, **any interpretation (e.g., desks occupied ÷ desks available)** would be speculative and is therefore not included per the rules.
