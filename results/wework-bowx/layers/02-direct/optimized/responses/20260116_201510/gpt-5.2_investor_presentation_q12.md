**Average revenue per member:** Not found in document.

**Citations:** The provided pages are largely redacted/bulleted without financial figures, and no section/page in the excerpt states “average revenue per member” or provides the inputs needed (total revenue and member count) to calculate it (slides/pages shown throughout the document excerpt, including the “All Access” slide and other bulleted sections).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the metric/value is not present in the provided document excerpt)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears incomplete or heavily redacted (many slides contain only bullets with no numbers), so the relevant metric may exist in omitted pages or in the original unredacted deck.
