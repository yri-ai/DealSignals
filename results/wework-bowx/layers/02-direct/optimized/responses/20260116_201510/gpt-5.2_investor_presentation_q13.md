**Total lease obligations:** **Not found in document.**

**Citations:** The provided pages are largely repeated “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” slides with minimal readable financial content; no slide/page includes a table, note, or section explicitly stating **“total lease obligations”** or providing amounts (entire provided document excerpt).

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly absent from provided document)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document excerpt appears incomplete and/or heavily redacted (many slides contain only bullet placeholders “•/●” with no figures), so lease obligation totals may exist in the full deck but are not present in the provided text.
