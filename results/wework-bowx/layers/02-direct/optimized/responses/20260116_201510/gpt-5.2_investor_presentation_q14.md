**Duration profile of lease commitments:** **Not found in document.**  

- The provided excerpt contains general narrative content (e.g., values statements) and a brief description of “All Access” (subscription model benefits), but **no table, chart, note, or section describing WeWork’s lease commitments by maturity/duration (e.g., 0–1 years, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5+ years) or weighted-average remaining lease term**. (No lease commitment maturity schedule appears in the provided pages; see the “All Access” slide content and surrounding pages.)

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly not present in the provided document excerpt).  

**Caveat / limitation:** The document appears to be an incomplete extract with many slides/pages redacted or missing; the lease commitment duration profile may exist in portions not included here.
