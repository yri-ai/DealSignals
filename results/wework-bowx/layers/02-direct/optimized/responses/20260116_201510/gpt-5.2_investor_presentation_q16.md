**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt contains a slide discussing “All Access” and notes it “drives occupancy” and “allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections,” but it does **not** state what specifically happens to the business at **70% occupancy** (section header: **“All Access”**).

**Confidence:** LOW (information not present in the provided document text)

**Caveat / limitation:** The document appears heavily redacted/blank in the provided extract (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet placeholders), so any quantitative occupancy threshold (e.g., 70%) and its business implications may exist in omitted pages/figures not included here.
