Not found in document. The provided pages include general statements about “All Access” and that it “Drives Occupancy” by allowing WeWork to “drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections,” but there is no discussion of what specifically happens to the business at **50% occupancy** (e.g., profitability, cash burn, break-even, operating actions, or financial impact) (section showing “All Access … Drives Occupancy … based on utilization projections”).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document excerpt does not contain any explicit 50% occupancy discussion).  
**Caveats / limitations:** The excerpt appears to be missing many slide contents (numerous pages show only bullets/placeholders and no readable metrics). If a slide on occupancy sensitivity exists, it is not included in the provided text.
