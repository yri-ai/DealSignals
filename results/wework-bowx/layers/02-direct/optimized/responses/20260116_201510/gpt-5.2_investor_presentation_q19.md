**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt contains general statements about WeWork’s values and a brief description of the “All Access” product economics (e.g., “High Margins,” “subscription-based model”), but it does **not** state any valuation methodology (e.g., DCF, trading comps, precedent transactions, or revenue/EBITDA multiple framework) used to justify the price. *(No page numbers or section headers with valuation methodology are present in the provided document excerpt; the only identifiable header is “All Access,” which describes product attributes rather than valuation.)*

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of valuation-methodology disclosure in the provided text).

**Caveats / limitations:** The document excerpt appears incomplete/redacted (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so valuation methodology may exist in omitted sections not included here.
