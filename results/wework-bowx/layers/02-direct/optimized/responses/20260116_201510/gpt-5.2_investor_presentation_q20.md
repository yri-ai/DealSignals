Not found in document. The provided excerpts do not cite any specific comparable transactions or comparable companies (no named peers, M&A/SPAC comps, or market comps appear in the text shown). **Confidence: HIGH.** Caveat: The document content appears heavily redacted/partial (many bullets with no text), so comps could exist in missing pages/sections.
