## SoftBank’s role and ongoing obligations

**Not found in document.**

The provided pages are largely redacted/blank (many slides show only bullets without text) and contain no section header or readable content describing **SoftBank’s role**, **its commitments**, or **any ongoing obligations** (e.g., lock-up, PIPE, backstop, voting agreements, governance rights, financing support).

### Caveats / limitations
- The document excerpt appears incomplete and heavily redacted (multiple pages contain only “•” placeholders), which may omit the relevant SPAC/transaction terms where SoftBank’s role and obligations would typically be described.

**Confidence: HIGH** (the information is not present in the provided document).
