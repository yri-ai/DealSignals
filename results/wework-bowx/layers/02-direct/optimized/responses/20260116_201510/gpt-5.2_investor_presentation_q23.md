Not found in document.

**Basis / citations:** The provided excerpted pages are largely placeholders (“© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.”) with limited visible content (e.g., values statements and an “All Access” product slide) and do not include any section or disclosure describing **related-party transactions** (no “Related Party Transactions” header, no named counterparties, no transaction descriptions).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the excerpt contains no related-party transaction disclosures).  

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears incomplete/redacted in the provided text (many pages show only confidentiality footers and bullet placeholders), so related-party transactions may exist in the full deck/proxy/financial statement notes but are **not present in the provided excerpt**.
