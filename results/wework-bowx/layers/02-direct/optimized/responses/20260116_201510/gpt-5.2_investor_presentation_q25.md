Not found in document.

**Support / citations:** The provided pages are largely redacted or contain general WeWork content (e.g., values statements and product description such as “All Access”), and do **not** mention **Adam Neumann** or describe any continuing role, ownership, voting rights, board/management involvement, consulting arrangements, or other ongoing financial exposure. (No relevant section headers or pages with Adam Neumann content are present in the excerpt provided.)

**Confidence:** HIGH (the name/relationship details are absent from the provided document)

**Caveats / limitations:** The excerpt appears incomplete/heavily redacted (many bullet-only pages), so Adam Neumann-related disclosures could exist in portions of the full deck/prospectus not included here.
