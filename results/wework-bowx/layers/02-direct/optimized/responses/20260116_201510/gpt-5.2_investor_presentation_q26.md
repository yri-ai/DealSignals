Not found in document.

**Support / citations:** The provided excerpt contains **no “Risk Factors” section, no enumerated risk disclosures, and no legible risk-factor text**—it is largely comprised of confidentiality footers and slides with bullet placeholders (e.g., pages showing only “•” or “●”) and non-risk content such as values statements and an “All Access” product description (see the values slide starting “We know the ‘right thing’…” and the “All Access” slide listing “On-Demand… / Generates Partnerships / Drives Occupancy / High Margins”). No slide is labeled “Risk Factors,” and no risks are stated in readable form.

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly not present in the provided document excerpt)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears **incomplete or heavily redacted** in the provided text capture (many pages show only bullets like “•”/“●” without the underlying content). If the full deck/filing includes a Risk Factors section, it was not included in what was provided here.
