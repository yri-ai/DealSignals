Material litigation or disputes: **Not found in document.**  

- The provided document excerpts do not include any section addressing **litigation**, **legal proceedings**, **claims**, **disputes**, **contingencies**, or similar disclosures (no relevant section headers/pages present in the provided text).  

**Confidence:** LOW (absence of evidence in the provided excerpts; the document may be incomplete or missing legal/disclosure sections).  

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The document appears to be a **partial/excerpted** set of slides with many redacted or placeholder bullets (“•”, “●”) and **no visible page numbers**, limiting the ability to confirm whether litigation/dispute disclosures exist elsewhere in the full deck.
