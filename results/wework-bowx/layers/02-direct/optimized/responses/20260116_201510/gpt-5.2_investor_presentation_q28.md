Not found in document. The provided excerpts contain branding/confidentiality footers and high-level narrative/product bullets (e.g., “All Access” description) but no financial statement footnotes, auditor’s report, or explicit “going concern”/“substantial doubt” language to assess going concern disclosures (no page numbers or section headers indicating such a disclosure are included in the text provided).

**Confidence:** HIGH (document excerpt does not include any going concern disclosure language)  
**Caveat/limitation:** The document appears incomplete/heavily redacted (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so a going concern disclosure could exist in omitted sections/pages; it is not verifiable from the provided content.
