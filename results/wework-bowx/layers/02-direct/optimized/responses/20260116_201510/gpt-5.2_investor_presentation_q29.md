Not found in document. The provided excerpt contains WeWork-branded slides with high-level statements (e.g., values language and a description of “All Access”) but **no auditor report, auditor opinion, audit firm name, or any quotation/summary of what auditors said** is included in the text shown (no page numbers or section headers referencing auditors appear in the provided material).

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence in provided document)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document excerpt appears incomplete/redacted (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so auditor commentary may exist in omitted pages not provided here.
