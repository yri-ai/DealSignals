Not found in document. The provided excerpts contain mostly confidentiality footers, values statements, and a high-level description of “All Access,” but no discussion of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), SOX controls, deficiencies, or “material weaknesses.” (No relevant section headers or page references provided beyond generic slides/footers: “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” throughout)

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of any internal-controls disclosure in the provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears incomplete/redacted (many bullet points and sections are truncated), and page numbers are not visible in the provided extract, so any internal-control disclosures could exist in omitted pages/sections.
