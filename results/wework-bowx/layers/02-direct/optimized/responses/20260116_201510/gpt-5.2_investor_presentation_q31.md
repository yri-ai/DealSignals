Not found in document.  

- The provided pages contain WeWork values text and high-level product/business descriptions (e.g., “All Access” benefits) but **do not include any section or page describing the post‑merger board composition (number of directors, names, independence, committees, or appointment rights)**. (No board/“Directors”/“Governance” section present in the provided extract.)

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence in provided document)  
**Caveat/limitation:** The extract appears incomplete (many pages are redacted or contain only bullets/headers), so the board composition could exist in omitted pages not included here.
