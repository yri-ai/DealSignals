Not found in document.  

**Caveat / limitation:** The provided excerpt appears to be a heavily redacted/partial WeWork confidential presentation (many slides show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), and it does not include any section describing **lock-up agreements** (e.g., sponsor lock-up, founder shares, PIPE investor lock-up, or employee/insider lock-ups). Therefore, the lock-up terms cannot be determined from this document.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document excerpt contains no lock-up agreement details).
