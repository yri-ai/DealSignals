**Caveats / limitations:** The provided extract appears to be an incomplete/pageless slide deck with many slides redacted or replaced by “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” placeholders and bullet dots (no readable “market context” slide, deal-time market data, or transaction-timing commentary is included). The only legible business-content sections relate to company values and an “All Access” product description (no deal-time market context is stated). **(No page numbers/section headers available beyond the visible “All Access” heading and values text.)**

**Confidence:** HIGH (the requested information is not present in the provided document text).
