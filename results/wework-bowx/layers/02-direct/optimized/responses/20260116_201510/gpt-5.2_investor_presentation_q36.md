**Not found in document.** The provided pages/slides are heavily redacted (many sections shown only as bullet placeholders “•”/“●”) and do not include any readable section or table describing **comparable transactions** (e.g., M&A comps, precedent transactions, transaction multiples). *(Document excerpts throughout; no identifiable “Comparable Transactions” section appears in the provided content.)*

**Confidence:** LOW (absence-of-evidence conclusion; document content appears incomplete/redacted)

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The document appears **incomplete and/or significantly redacted**, so comparable transactions **may exist in omitted pages** but are **not visible** in the provided material. *(Multiple slides show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with placeholder bullets “•/●”.)*
