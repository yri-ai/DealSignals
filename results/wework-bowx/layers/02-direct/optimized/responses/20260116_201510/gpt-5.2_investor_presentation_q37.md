**Exit/refinancing strategy for lease obligations:** **Not found in document.**

- The provided document text contains general company values and product/strategy descriptions (e.g., “All Access” benefits such as “High Margins” and “subscription-based model” language), but it does **not** describe any **exit strategy**, **refinancing plan**, or other approach specifically addressing **lease obligations** (no relevant section header or page content provided in the excerpt).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the excerpted document content does not include any stated strategy for exiting/refinancing lease obligations)

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The document appears to be an incomplete text extraction with many redacted/bulleted sections and no visible page numbers; if an “exit/refinancing strategy” exists, it may be in omitted pages/sections not included in the provided material.
