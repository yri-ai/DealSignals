Not found in document.

- The provided excerpt contains high-level statements about WeWork’s values (e.g., integrity, shared purpose, courage, gratitude, community) but does not describe any **post‑merger integration plan** or **specific planned business model changes tied to the SPAC merger** (values text section: “We know the ‘right thing’…,” “We’ve always believed…,” “To reshape the way…,” “We will not take…,” “Collaboration, kindness…”).
- The excerpt describes **“All Access”** as an offering (on-demand/pay‑as‑you‑go or monthly subscription providing access to a global network, generating partnerships, driving occupancy beyond physical capacity based on utilization projections, and providing high incremental margins) but does not state this as a *post‑merger* change or integration initiative (section block titled/headed “All Access”).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the excerpt does not include post-merger integration details; this is a direct absence).  
**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears heavily truncated/redacted (many pages show only bullets or confidentiality marks), and no page numbers are visible in the provided text, which limits precise citation beyond identifiable section headers/quoted blocks.
