Not found in document.  

**Caveats / limitations:** The provided excerpt appears to be a heavily redacted/presentation-style document (many slides show only bullets or “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with minimal legible content), and it contains no section headers or pages detailing debt agreements, covenant terms (e.g., leverage/coverage ratios), or restriction language (e.g., limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, dividends, investments). Therefore, debt covenants and restrictions cannot be determined from the supplied text.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the excerpt contains no covenant or restriction disclosures).
