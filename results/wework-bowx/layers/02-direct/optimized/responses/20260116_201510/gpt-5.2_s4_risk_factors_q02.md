Not found in document.

**Caveat / limitation:** The document provides WeWork revenue for the **six months ended June 30, 2021** and for fiscal years **2020, 2019 and 2018** (see **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK — Consolidated Statements of Operations Data” (p. 23)**), but it does **not** provide revenue for the comparable **six months ended June 30, 2020** or any explicit “year-over-year revenue growth rate” calculation. Therefore, a YoY growth rate cannot be calculated from the information provided in this excerpt.

**Confidence:** HIGH (the required YoY growth rate is not presented, and the needed comparable-period revenue is not provided in the excerpt).
