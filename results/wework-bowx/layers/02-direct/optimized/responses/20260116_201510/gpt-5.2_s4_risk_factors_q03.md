**Operating loss (most recent period disclosed):** **$2,355,793 thousand (i.e., $2.356 billion) loss from operations** for the **six months ended June 30, 2021** (WeWork). This is presented as “Loss from operations” in WeWork’s selected historical financial information. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”**, table “Consolidated Statements of Operations Data,” **p. 23**)

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly stated).

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The document provides “Loss from operations” for WeWork, but for BowX it provides “Operating Expenses” rather than an “operating loss” line item in its selected historical financial information. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BOWX,” p. 21**)  
- The “most recent period” in the excerpted financial tables is the **six months ended June 30, 2021**; later interim periods are **not included** in the provided document text. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK,” p. 23**)
