## Cash burn rate
**Not found in document.**

### What related cash-flow information is provided (but insufficient to calculate “burn rate”)
- The document provides **WeWork net cash used in operating activities** of **$(1,158,957) thousand** for the **six months ended June 30, 2021** (i.e., about **$1.159 billion**), but it does **not** label this as “cash burn rate,” nor does it provide a definition of burn rate or a monthly burn figure. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data”**, p. **24**)
- It also provides **WeWork Free Cash Flow** of **$(1,312,099) thousand** for the **six months ended June 30, 2021** (about **$1.312 billion**), defined as operating cash flow less capex, but again not expressed as a burn “rate” and not consistently provided as a per-month or per-quarter metric. (Section: **“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”**, p. **25**)

### Caveats / limitations
- The document does not define **“cash burn rate”** (e.g., operating cash burn vs. free cash flow burn; gross vs. net of financing; per month vs. per quarter), so even with cash-flow totals provided, a burn **rate** cannot be stated directly from the text. (Sections: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”** p. **23–25**)

**Confidence: HIGH** (the document does not explicitly provide a “cash burn rate” metric; only partial inputs like operating cash flow and free cash flow are shown).
