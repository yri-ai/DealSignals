## Cash runway at current burn rate
**Not found in document.** The filing excerpt provided does not disclose (i) a defined “current burn rate” for the combined company or WeWork (e.g., monthly net cash used in operations or free cash flow burn), nor (ii) a cash balance explicitly positioned as “available cash” for runway purposes post-close that can be matched to that burn rate to calculate a runway period.

### What related data is in the document (but insufficient to compute runway)
- WeWork historical operating cash flow and Free Cash Flow (which could be used to approximate a burn rate) are disclosed only for **six months ended June 30, 2021** and annual periods, not as a “current” monthly burn rate:
  - Net cash used in operating activities: **$(1,158,957) thousand** for six months ended June 30, 2021. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK — Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data”**, p. **23**)
  - Free Cash Flow: **$(1,312,099) thousand** for six months ended June 30, 2021. (Section: **“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”**, p. **25**)
- Cash sources discussed for the transaction include:
  - Trust account illustrative balance as of June 30, 2021: **approximately $483.1 million**. (Section: **“SPECIAL MEETING… — Redemption Rights”** / Q&A redemption discussion, p. **iii** and repeated in **Q&A “Do I have redemption rights?”**, p. **xxiii–xxiv**)
  - PIPE Investment: **$800,000,000** gross proceeds. (Cover letter / summary and Q&A, e.g., **preliminary letter to stockholders**, and **Q&A “Will the Company obtain new financing…”**, p. **xxii**; also **Summary—PIPE Subscription Agreements**, p. **5–6**)
  - A minimum available cash condition: Trust Amount + PIPE must be **at least $800.0 million**. (Notice / redemption discussion, p. **iv**; and **Selected Definitions — “Minimum Available Cash Condition”**, p. **xii**)

### Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt does not provide the **post-closing net cash** available after redemptions, fees, expenses, and other uses, nor a **current-period monthly burn rate** definition. (See **“BCA Proposal — Sources and Uses of Funds…”** referenced but not included in the provided excerpt; cited as referenced section at **Q&A “What happens to the funds deposited in the trust account…”**, p. **xxvi**.)

**Confidence: HIGH** (directly not computable from the provided document excerpt; required inputs not present).
