## Path to profitability and stated timeline

**Path to profitability (stated):**
- WeWork’s “new strategic plan” emphasizes **“achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations”** and **focusing on optimizing its existing real estate portfolio** (including lease amendments/exits) and executing on the current pipeline before pursuing additional growth. This is presented as the core profitability approach. *(“RISK FACTORS — The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management…”, page 37)*

**Timeline (stated):**
- The document **does not state a specific timeline or date/period by which profitability (GAAP net income) or positive Adjusted EBITDA will be achieved.** *(Not found in document—no explicit profitability timeline is provided in the excerpts; see discussion of strategy without timing in “RISK FACTORS — The Company is undergoing a transformation…”, page 37, and “RISK FACTORS — The Company has a history of losses and it may be unable to achieve profitability…”, page 34)*

## Confidence and caveats
- **Confidence: HIGH** for the profitability *path* (directly stated strategic plan focused on positive Adjusted EBITDA via cost management and portfolio optimization). *(Risk Factors, page 37)*
- **Confidence: HIGH** that a *timeline* is not provided (the cited sections discuss goals and uncertainty but give no target date). *(Risk Factors, pages 34 and 37)*
- **Caveat/limitation:** The strategy is framed as a plan with explicit uncertainty—**“there can be no assurances that this new business strategy will be successful”** and **“there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in realizing the benefits of this plan.”** *(Risk Factors, pages 37 and 34)*
