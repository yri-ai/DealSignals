## Key assumptions underlying the projections

**Not found in document.**

### What is available (but not the underlying projection assumptions)
- The document includes **selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information** and indicates it is prepared under **two illustrative scenarios** regarding redemptions (**“Assuming No Redemption”** and **“Assuming Maximum Possible Redemption”**) rather than management “projections” assumptions. (Section: **“SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION”**, pp. **25–27**)
- It also notes key **transaction-related assumptions** for the pro forma presentation (e.g., consummation date assumptions; PIPE issuance; conversion/exchange of securities; sponsor share conversion). (Section: **“SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION”**, p. **25**)

### Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt provided does **not** include a management projection section (e.g., forecasted revenue/EBITDA/cash flow) or any explicit list of **projection assumptions** (macroeconomic, occupancy, pricing, margins, capex, etc.).  
- The pro forma information described is explicitly **illustrative** and “does not purport to represent” future results. (Section: **“SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION”**, pp. **25–26**; also **“COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA”**, p. **28**)

**Confidence: HIGH** (the document excerpt does not contain projection assumptions; only pro forma scenario assumptions are described).
