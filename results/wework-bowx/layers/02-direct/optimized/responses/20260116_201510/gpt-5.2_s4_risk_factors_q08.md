**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt includes WeWork non-GAAP measures such as **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Free Cash Flow** (see section header **“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”**, p. **24–25**), plus various operational metrics (e.g., memberships decline, month-to-month commitments) in **“Risk Factors”** (p. **31–33**), but it does **not** define or disclose **“contribution margin per membership”** or provide the components needed to calculate it.

**Confidence:** HIGH (explicitly not present in the provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:** The excerpt appears incomplete relative to the full S‑4/A; the metric could exist elsewhere in the full filing (e.g., within **“WeWork’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis…”** beginning on p. **237** per the table of contents), but that content is not included in the provided document extract.
