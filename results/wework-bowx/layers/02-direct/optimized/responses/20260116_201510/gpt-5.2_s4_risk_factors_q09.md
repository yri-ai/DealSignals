**Revenue per available desk/workstation:** **Not found in document.**  
- The document provides WeWork revenue figures (e.g., “Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork” shows revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and for FY 2020/2019/2018), but it does **not** provide “available desks/workstations” counts or a stated “revenue per available desk/workstation” KPI needed to compute this metric. (Section: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”**, p. **23**)  
- While the document defines certain operational metrics such as **“Physical Occupancy”** (defined as “the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations”), it still does not disclose the **total workstations (available desks/workstations)** figure required to calculate revenue per available desk/workstation. (Section: **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**, definition of **“Physical Occupancy”**, p. **xiii**)  

**Confidence:** **HIGH** (explicitly absent from provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- Calculating “revenue per available desk/workstation” requires (i) a revenue period and (ii) a disclosed count of available desks/workstations (or total workstations). The provided excerpt includes revenue but not the workstation count, so the metric cannot be derived from the document excerpt. (Sections: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”**, p. **23**; **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**, p. **xiii**)
