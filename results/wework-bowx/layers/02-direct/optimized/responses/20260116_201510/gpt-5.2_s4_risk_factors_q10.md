## Occupancy rate (definition)

The document does **not** provide a definition of an overall “occupancy rate” metric (i.e., a single reported occupancy rate for WeWork such as % occupied). **Not found in document**.

However, it does define a related KPI:

- **Physical Occupancy** is defined as **“the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations.”** (Section: **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**, definition of “Physical Occupancy”, p. **xiii**)

## How it has trended

The document does **not** provide historical values or a trend for “occupancy rate” or for “Physical Occupancy” over time. **Not found in document**.

The closest disclosed “trend-like” metric is **total memberships**, which is different from occupancy rate:

- WeWork states that **total memberships declined 16%** between the quarter ended **June 30, 2020** and the quarter ended **June 30, 2021** (Section: **“RISK FACTORS — The COVID-19 pandemic…”**, p. **31**; and repeated in **“The Company may not be able to continue to retain existing members…”**, p. **32**). This is **not** an occupancy-rate trend and cannot be converted to occupancy without workstations data, which is not provided in the excerpt.

## Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt includes a definition for **Physical Occupancy** but **no reported occupancy percentages**, and **no workstation counts**, so an occupancy trend cannot be calculated from the provided text (Section: **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**, p. **xiii**; **Risk Factors**, pp. **31–32**).

## Confidence
- Definition of Physical Occupancy: **HIGH** (explicitly defined; p. xiii).
- Occupancy/Physical Occupancy trend: **HIGH** that it is **not provided** (no values/trend disclosed in the provided excerpt).
