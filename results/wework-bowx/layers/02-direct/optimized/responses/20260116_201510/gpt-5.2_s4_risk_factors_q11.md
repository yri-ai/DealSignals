**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt discusses membership declines (e.g., “total memberships…declined 16%” between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021) and references “member churn” qualitatively, but it does **not** define or report a **member churn rate** as a specific metric (see **“RISK FACTORS — Risks Relating to the Company’s Business”**, pp. **31–33**).

## Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt mentions “member churn” as a risk and provides a **membership decline percentage** over a year, but that is not presented as a “churn rate” nor with a standard churn definition (e.g., cancellations over beginning-of-period members) (pp. **31–33**, **Risk Factors** section).

**Confidence: HIGH** (explicit absence of a stated “member churn rate” in the provided document excerpt).
