Not found in document. The provided excerpt includes WeWork revenue totals (e.g., $1,191,331 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021) but does not provide the number of “members” (or an average member count) needed to calculate “average revenue per member,” nor does it present that metric directly. (Section: “SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”)

**Confidence:** HIGH (metric not stated and required inputs not provided)

**Caveat / limitation:** Without a defined member count over the relevant period (e.g., average memberships or average physical memberships) and a definition of “member” consistent with revenue recognition, the metric cannot be computed from this excerpt.
