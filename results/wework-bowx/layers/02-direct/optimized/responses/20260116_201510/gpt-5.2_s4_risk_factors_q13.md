“Total lease obligations” is **not explicitly defined** in the provided excerpt, and the document does **not** provide a single summarized figure labeled “total lease obligations.” **Not found in document** (no section in the provided text defines a metric explicitly called “total lease obligations”).

However, the document does disclose a closely related figure: **future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases**, which appears to be the best available proxy within the provided text:

- As of **June 30, 2021**, WeWork’s subsidiaries’ **future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases were $36.6 billion** (Risk Factors—“The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases may limit the Company’s operating flexibility and could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations,” page **34**).

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (derived as the closest disclosed proxy for “total lease obligations,” but not labeled as such).

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The $36.6 billion figure is specifically described as **future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations** under signed leases, and therefore may differ from other possible definitions of “total lease obligations” (e.g., GAAP lease liabilities, discounted obligations, inclusion/exclusion of variable rent, or obligations under non-lease occupancy structures) (Risk Factors section, page **34**).
- The disclosure indicates leases are “primarily entered into by and through special purpose entity subsidiaries,” so obligations may be held at subsidiaries even if consolidated in results (Risk Factors section, page **34**).
