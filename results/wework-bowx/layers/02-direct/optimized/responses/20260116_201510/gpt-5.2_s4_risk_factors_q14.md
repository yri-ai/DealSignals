**What is provided instead (related but not a “duration profile”):**
- The document states that WeWork’s **average length of the initial term of its leases is approximately 15 years**, and that the **average term of its membership agreements is 15 months** (Risk Factors — “The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases may limit the Company’s operating flexibility and could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations,” p. 33).
- It also discloses that as of **June 30, 2021**, WeWork’s subsidiaries’ **future undiscounted minimum lease cost payment obligations under signed operating and finance leases were $36.6 billion**, but it does **not break these obligations out by maturity buckets** (same Risk Factors section, p. 33).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the specific “duration profile”/maturity schedule is not presented in the provided excerpt; only averages and aggregate obligations are shown).

**Caveats / limitations:**
- A “duration profile” typically implies a maturity schedule (e.g., payments due in 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5+ years). The provided text does not include such a schedule—only an average initial lease term and a total undiscounted obligation figure (Risk Factors section, p. 33).
