The document describes **lease termination provisions only at a high level**, and mainly emphasizes that WeWork’s leases generally **do not** allow early termination.

## Lease termination provisions (as described in the document)

- **Most leases do not contain early termination provisions.** The document states that WeWork’s long-term leases “**with limited exceptions, do not contain early termination provisions**.” (Risk Factors — *“The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases may limit the Company’s operating flexibility…”*, p. 33)

- **Lease terminations/exits are occurring primarily through negotiated restructurings/exits (not contractual early termination).** The document explains WeWork is executing “**full or partial lease exits**” and has “**negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits** with landlord partners,” indicating these are negotiated outcomes rather than standard lease termination rights. (Risk Factors — *“The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan…”*, p. 37)

- **Some occupancy arrangements contain termination penalties.** The document notes WeWork is increasingly using “management agreements, participating leases and other occupancy arrangements,” and that “**Some of the Company’s agreements contain penalties that are payable in the event the Company terminates the arrangement**.” (Risk Factors — *“The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases…”*, p. 35)

## Not found in document (limitations)
- Specific **contractual termination clauses**, notice periods, termination fees, default/termination triggers, or differences by lease type **are not provided** in the excerpted document. **Not found in document.**

## Confidence
- **HIGH** for statements that leases generally lack early termination provisions and that some arrangements have termination penalties (directly stated in Risk Factors cited above).
- **LOW** regarding any further specifics because the document does not provide detailed lease-by-lease provisions or standardized termination terms.
