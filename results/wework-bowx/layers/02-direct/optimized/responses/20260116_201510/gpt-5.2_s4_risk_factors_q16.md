Not found in document. The provided excerpt does not disclose (i) what “70% occupancy” refers to (e.g., physical occupancy, desk occupancy, breakeven occupancy, or an internal KPI threshold), nor (ii) the operational or financial impacts on WeWork/New WeWork “at 70% occupancy.” The document defines **“Physical Occupancy”** as “the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations” but does not state consequences at a 70% level (Section: **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**, definition of “Physical Occupancy,” p. **xiii**).  

## Confidence  
LOW — Not found in document.

## Caveats / limitations  
- The excerpt includes general risk disclosures about occupancy reductions and membership churn (e.g., memberships declined 16% between Q2’20 and Q2’21) but does not quantify outcomes at a 70% occupancy level (Section: **“RISK FACTORS — Risks Relating to the Company’s Business”**, pp. **31–33**).  
- Additional details might exist elsewhere in the full S-4/A (e.g., MD&A or KPI tables), but they are not included in the provided text.
