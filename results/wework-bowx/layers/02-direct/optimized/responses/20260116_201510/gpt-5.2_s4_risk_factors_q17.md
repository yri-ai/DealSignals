**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt discusses WeWork’s memberships, leases, and certain KPIs (e.g., “Physical Occupancy” is defined as “the number of physical memberships divided by total workstations”), but it does **not** describe what happens to the business specifically **at 50% occupancy** (e.g., operational, financial breakeven, cash burn, or lease-level economics at that occupancy level). See **“Selected Definitions” (definition of “Physical Occupancy”)** and **“Risk Factors”** for general discussion of demand declines and fixed lease costs, but no 50% occupancy scenario is provided. (Sections: **“SELECTED DEFINITIONS”**; **“RISK FACTORS — Risks Relating to the Company’s Business — The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases…”**)

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document excerpt contains no 50% occupancy scenario or outcome discussion).

**Caveat / limitation:** The excerpt appears incomplete relative to the full S-4/A; if the full filing includes occupancy-sensitivity analysis, it is not present in the provided text.
