**Not found in document.** The excerpted S-4/A does **not** describe a valuation methodology (e.g., DCF, public comparables, precedent transactions, fairness opinion analysis) used to *justify the merger price/valuation*.

What *is* stated is that the merger consideration is set at a **deemed value of $10.00 per share**, representing a **pre-transaction equity value of approximately $6.553 billion** for WeWork (Letter to BowX Stockholders / transaction summary; also “Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus — Aggregate Merger Consideration”) and that the BowX board **did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion** (Questions and Answers for Stockholders of BowX — “Did the board… obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion”). These statements do not specify a valuation *methodology*.

**Confidence:** HIGH (explicitly absent; only fixed per-share deemed value and no fairness opinion are stated).  

**Caveat / limitation:** This answer is based only on the provided excerpt; the full S-4/A may contain valuation discussion elsewhere (e.g., “BCA Proposal — BowX’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Business Combination” or any financial advisor materials), but it is not included in the provided text.
