## Comparable transactions or companies cited

### Companies (as transaction counterparties or comparators)
- **Cushman & Wakefield plc** — cited in connection with “our non-binding partnership with Cushman & Wakefield plc (“Cushman”)” (section **“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”**, p. **xxxv**; also referenced in the risk factor summary, p. **19**).  
- **SoftBank Group Corp. (SBG)** and affiliates including **SB WW Holdings (Cayman) Limited (SBWW)** and **SVF Endurance (Cayman) Limited (SVFE)** — cited repeatedly as key related parties / financing counterparties (see **“Selected Definitions”** for SBG/SBWW/SVFE, pp. **xiii–xiv**; also discussed under **“Risk Factors—The Company has engaged in transactions with related parties…”**, p. **40**).  
- **Trustbridge Partners** — cited as an investment counterparty in WeWork’s Greater China joint venture restructuring (“Trustbridge Transaction”) (section **“Risk Factors—A significant part of the Company’s international growth strategy…”**, p. **41**).  
- **Ampa Group (“Ampa”)** — cited as counterparty to the “Israel Transaction” granting exclusive right to operate WeWork’s business in Israel (section **“Risk Factors—A significant part of the Company’s international growth strategy…”**, p. **41**).

### Comparable transactions
- **Not found in document** — The provided excerpt does not cite “comparable transactions” (in the valuation/precedent-transaction sense) used to benchmark the SPAC merger valuation. The only “transactions” explicitly described are WeWork’s own restructuring/joint venture transactions and related agreements (e.g., “Trustbridge Transaction,” “Israel Transaction”), not valuation comparables (see **Risk Factors**, pp. **41–42**).

## Caveats / limitations
- The document excerpt provided includes corporate counterparties and specific WeWork-related transactions and partnerships, but it does **not** present a formal comps set (trading comps or precedent transactions) for valuation benchmarking. (Inferred from absence of such a section in the provided text; **Not found in document** for explicit comparable-valuation discussion.)

**Confidence:** **HIGH** for listed cited companies/transactions (directly stated in cited sections/pages); **HIGH** for “Not found in document” regarding formal comparable transactions (no such comparables appear in the provided excerpt).
