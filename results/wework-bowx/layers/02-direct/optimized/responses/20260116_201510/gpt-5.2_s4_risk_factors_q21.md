## Track record (as described in document)

### WeWork / New WeWork management track record
- The document states that **WeWork’s management team “has decades of public market experience” and “has demonstrated proven results within their first 12 months at WeWork,”** and identifies leadership by **Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure** and **CEO Sandeep Mathrani (joined Feb. 2020)**; it also states that **under their leadership, WeWork “refocused on its core business model” and applied “a disciplined approach to costs.”** *(“BowX’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Business Combination — Experienced and Proven Management Team” section, page 15)*

### Specific, quantifiable performance/“track record” details for individual executives
- **Not found in document** (no executive-by-executive career history, prior roles at other companies, or quantified KPIs directly attributed to named executives beyond the general statements above). *(Limitation: while the document refers readers to “Management of New WeWork Following the Business Combination,” it does not provide those details in the provided excerpt; see “BowX’s Board of Directors’ Reasons…” section referencing that additional section, page 15.)*

## Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt provides **names and roles** of key directors/officers and **high-level qualitative statements** about management experience and early progress, but **does not include detailed biographies or specific historical performance metrics** per executive. *(Pages xxii–xxiii; page 15)*

## Confidence rating
- **Key executives list:** HIGH (directly listed). *(Pages xxii–xxiii)*
- **Track record statements:** HIGH for the qualitative claims (directly stated), LOW for any deeper/individual track record details (not found). *(Page 15)*
