## Management’s incentives/compensation in the deal (as described in the document)

### 1) BowX (SPAC) sponsor / BowX directors and officers — economic incentives tied to closing
The document states that BowX’s initial stockholders (including the Sponsor) and BowX’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Business Combination that “are different from, or in addition to, those of BowX stockholders” and could create conflicts. These include:  
- **Founder equity and private warrants that become worthless if no deal closes**: beneficial ownership of **12,075,000 shares of BowX Class B common stock** and **7,773,333 private placement warrants**, which “would become worthless if BowX does not complete a business combination within the applicable time period,” because the initial stockholders “have waived any redemption right with respect to these shares.” The Sponsor paid **$25,000** for the Class B shares and **$11,660,000** for the private placement warrants. (Section: **“SUMMARY OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS — Interests of BowX’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Business Combination”**, p. **13**)  
- **Non-redemption commitment**: the Sponsor, officers and directors “have agreed not to redeem any of their shares” in connection with the stockholder vote. (Same section, p. **13**)  
- **Board role / continued position**: “anticipated continuation of Mr. Ranadivé as a director of New WeWork.” (Same section, p. **13**)  
- **Registration rights (liquidity facilitation)**: at Closing, BowX expects to enter into a **Registration Rights Agreement** providing registration rights to the initial stockholders (including the Sponsor) and BowX directors and officers (and permitted transferees). (Same section, p. **13**; see also **“Related Agreements — Registration Rights Agreement”**, p. **5**)  
- **Indemnification and D&O insurance continuation**: continued indemnification of current BowX directors and officers and continuation of D&O insurance after Closing. (Same section, p. **13**)  
- **Expense reimbursement**: Sponsor, officers and directors will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on BowX’s behalf (though it notes there have been no material reimbursable expenses and none anticipated prior to Closing). (Same section, p. **13**)  
- **“Lose their entire investment” if no deal closes**: explicitly states Sponsor/officers/directors would lose their investment if an initial business combination is not completed. (Same section, p. **13**)

Related structural incentive for the Sponsor:  
- **Forfeiture of 3,000,000 Class B shares** agreed in the Sponsor Support Agreement (a negotiated concession connected to the transaction). (Section: **“Related Agreements — Sponsor Support Agreement”**, p. **5**; also described in the cover letter narrative before the table of contents)

### 2) WeWork executive officers — transaction bonuses and equity vesting acceleration condition
The document explicitly describes transaction-related compensation for WeWork executives:  
- **CEO transaction bonus**: upon consummation of the Business Combination, **Sandeep Mathrani (CEO)** will be entitled to a **$10.0 million payment**, subject to repayment obligations (full after-tax repayment if he resigns without good reason or is terminated for cause on/before **Jan 31, 2022**; 50% repayment if such termination occurs after Jan 31, 2022 but on/before **Jan 31, 2023**). (Section: **“SUMMARY OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS — Interests of WeWork’s Executive Officers in the Business Combination”**, p. **14**)  
- **Other executive transaction bonus allocations**: target bonuses allocated to other WeWork executive officers: **Anthony Yazbeck ($2.0m), Ben Dunham ($1.5m), Jared DeMatteis ($1.5m), Lauren Fritts ($1.0m), Peter Greenspan ($1.0m), Hamid Hashemi ($750k), Scott Morey ($300k), Maral Kazanjian ($250k), Roger Solé Rafols ($250k)**; subject to the same repayment mechanics; amounts are **target only** and may be adjusted in CEO’s sole discretion subject to an **aggregate cap of $11.5m**. (Same section, p. **14**)  
- **Separate bonus for COO promotion**: Anthony Yazbeck received a **one-time bonus of GBP 1.44 million**, payable within 30 days following closing, subject to continued employment through payment date. (Same section, p. **14**)  
- **Equity awards liquidity-event condition satisfied at closing**: WeWork executive officers hold certain **RSU awards with a “liquidity event condition”**, which will be satisfied by the Business Combination; as of July 15, 2021, executives held an aggregate of **4,347,818** such RSUs (assuming maximum performance), with **8,863** fully vesting upon consummation and the remainder continuing to vest based on service/performance. (Same section, p. **14**)
