The document also clarifies he is a **\u201cnonvoting board observer \u2014 not as a director\u201d** and has **no contractual entitlement beyond customary observer attendance**. (Risk Factors section; page 40)\n\n4) **Exposure via related-party landlord transactions and ongoing lease-exit discussions involving related parties.**  \n   The document notes WeWork previously entered into lease/landlord transactions where Neumann (or related entities) **had ownership interests**, and that **\u201cas part of the Company\u2019s restructuring, the Company is in ongoing discussions to exit certain leases with related parties.\u201d** It warns these related-party transactions create **potential conflicts of interest** (e.g., lease remedies and default treatment) and could result in adverse effects, enforcement actions, investigations, or litigation. (Risk Factors section; page 40)\n\n5) **General related-party transaction context (Neumann referenced as former CEO/director involved in past related-party arrangements).**  \n   Neumann is identified as the Company\u2019s **\u201cformer chief executive officer and former member of the Company\u2019s board of directors\u201d** and tied to past related-party landlord relationships, which present conflict risk. (Risk Factors section; page 40)\n\n---\n\n### Caveats / limitations\n- The document **does not quantify** any expected costs, probabilities, or governance impact specifically attributable to Neumann\u2019s observer rights beyond the described rights/limitations. (Risk Factors section; page 40)\n- The observer rights begin in the future (Feb. 26, 2022) and are **conditional on continued ownership**, so the duration is uncertain.
