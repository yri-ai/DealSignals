## Adam Neumann — ongoing relationship / exposure (per document)

1) **Board observer rights starting Feb. 26, 2022 (or via a designee requested by SoftBank Group).**  
   The document states that WeWork **“has entered into an agreement that grants Mr. Neumann board observer rights.”** Beginning **February 26, 2022**, **“Mr. Neumann, or if requested by SBG, a designee of Mr. Neumann’s (who shall be subject to SBG’s approval), shall have the right to observe meetings of New WeWork’s board of directors (and certain committees thereof) in a non-voting observer capacity”** and is **“entitled to copies of written materials provided to directors, subject to certain conditions.”** (Risk Factors section, discussion of related party transactions / Neumann observer rights; page 40)

2) **Observer rights continue only while Neumann maintains a minimum ownership threshold.**  
   The observer rights **terminate** when Neumann **“ceases to beneficially own equity securities of WeWork (including WeWork Partnerships Profits Interest Units) representing at least 19,028,251 shares of WeWork Class A Common Stock (on an as-converted basis and as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like).”** (Risk Factors section; page 40)

3) **Confidentiality obligation and company’s right to exclude/withhold information in certain cases (limits on influence, but still information access risk).**  
   The agreement requires Neumann (or his representative) **“agree to hold in confidence all information provided”** and New WeWork **“reserved the right … to withhold information and exclude Mr. Neumann or his representative”** where disclosure could harm privilege, disclose trade secrets, create a conflict of interest, or if Neumann violates restrictive covenants. The document also clarifies he is a **“nonvoting board observer — not as a director”** and has **no contractual entitlement beyond customary observer attendance**. (Risk Factors section; page 40)

4) **Exposure via related-party landlord transactions and ongoing lease-exit discussions involving related parties.**  
   The document notes WeWork previously entered into lease/landlord transactions where Neumann (or related entities) **had ownership interests**, and that **“as part of the Company’s restructuring, the Company is in ongoing discussions to exit certain leases with related parties.”** It warns these related-party transactions create **potential conflicts of interest** (e.g., lease remedies and default treatment) and could result in adverse effects, enforcement actions, investigations, or litigation. (Risk Factors section; page 40)

5) **General related-party transaction context (Neumann referenced as former CEO/director involved in past related-party arrangements).**  
   Neumann is identified as the Company’s **“former chief executive officer and former member of the Company’s board of directors”** and tied to past related-party landlord relationships, which present conflict risk. (Risk Factors section; page 40)

### Caveats / limitations
- The document **does not quantify** any expected costs, probabilities, or governance impact specifically attributable to Neumann’s observer rights beyond the described rights/limitations. (Risk Factors section; page 40)
- The observer rights begin in the future (Feb. 26, 2022) and are **conditional on continued ownership**, so the duration is uncertain. (Risk Factors section; page 40)

### Confidence rating
**HIGH** — these points are directly stated in the Risk Factors discussion of Neumann’s observer rights and related-party transactions (page 40).
