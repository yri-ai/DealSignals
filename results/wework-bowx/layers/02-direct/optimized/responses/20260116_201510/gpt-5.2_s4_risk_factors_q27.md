## Material litigation or disputes

**Yes.** The document discloses litigation/disputes in multiple contexts, including:

1) **Landlord-related litigation arising from lease optimization / rent withholding**
- The document states that, as part of WeWork’s real estate portfolio optimization, *“in connection with these optimization efforts, at certain locations the Company has withheld, is withholding, or may in the future withhold rent payments for some period of time”* and that *“in a small number of cases, the Company’s real estate portfolio optimization efforts have resulted in litigation filed by landlords”*; it further notes that *“additional litigation could result”* and WeWork could be exposed to *“breach of contract, eviction or other claims”* with direct/indirect costs and operational disruptions. (Section: **Risk Factors — “The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan…”**, pp. **37–38**)

- The document also states that *“In certain circumstances, landlords have drawn under the letters of credit or demanded payment under the surety bonds… [and] a small number of landlords have sued to enforce the corporate guarantees.”* (Section: **Risk Factors — “The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases…”**, pp. **34–35**)

2) **Legal costs/reserves tied to the 2019 withdrawn IPO and SoftBank Transactions**
- The definition of Adjusted EBITDA includes add-backs for *“significant legal costs incurred by WeWork in connection with regulatory investigations and litigation regarding WeWork’s 2019 withdrawn initial public offering and the related execution of the SoftBank Transactions”*. (Section: **Selected Definitions — “Adjusted EBITDA”**, p. **x**; also referenced again in **Non-GAAP Financial Measures**, p. **24**)

3) **Indemnification-related legal fee payments**
- The document states WeWork has agreed to indemnify certain current and former directors/executive officers/shareholders and that *“in 2020, paid approximately $14 million in legal fees related to these indemnifications, outside of the amounts covered by insurance.”* (Section: **Risk Factors — “The Company has engaged in transactions with related parties…”**, p. **40**)

## Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt does **not** quantify total litigation exposure, list specific case names, venues, or damages sought; it describes litigation categories and states only that litigation exists in a “small number of cases.” (Risk Factors cited above)

## Confidence: HIGH
- Litigation/disputes are directly stated in the Risk Factors and definitions sections.
