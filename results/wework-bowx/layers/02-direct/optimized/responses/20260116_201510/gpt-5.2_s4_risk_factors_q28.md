## Are there going concern disclosures?

**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt includes sections such as “Selected Historical Financial Information of BowX” (p. 21), “Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork” (pp. 23–25), “Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” (pp. 26–27), “Market Price and Dividend Information” (p. 30), and the beginning of “Risk Factors” (p. 31), but it **does not include any explicit “going concern” disclosure language** (e.g., “substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern”) in the text shown.  

### Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt appears to be only part of the full S-4/A; a going concern paragraph could exist in the **full financial statements and notes (Index to Financial Statements starts at F-1)**, which are referenced but not included in the provided content (Table of Contents shows “INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-1” and “WEWORK FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-1” / “BOWX FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-1”).  

**Confidence: HIGH** (for the provided excerpt only; the term and disclosure are not present in the supplied text).
