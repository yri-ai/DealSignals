Not found in document. The provided excerpt includes selected financial information, pro forma information, risk factors, and transaction terms, but it does **not** include an auditors’ report/opinion (e.g., an independent registered public accounting firm’s report with audit opinion language). See “Selected Historical Financial Information of BowX” and “Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork,” which state the financial statements are included elsewhere but do not reproduce the auditors’ opinion in this excerpt (sections: **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF BOWX”** (p. 20–22) and **“SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF WEWORK”** (p. 23–25)).  

**Caveat/limitation:** The table of contents shows an “INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-1” (Table of Contents, p. vii), implying audit reports may appear in the F-pages not included in the provided text.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (explicitly absent from the provided excerpt).
