**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt does not contain any explicit statement that BowX, WeWork, or New WeWork has identified **“material weaknesses”** in internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), nor any section describing an ICFR assessment or specific control deficiencies.

**Related disclosure (risk discussion, but not a material weakness finding):**
- The Risk Factors include that “**WeWork’s internal controls, financial systems and procedures need further development for a public company and a company of its global scale**” (section **“RISK FACTORS”**, bullet list in the “Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,” **page 19**). This is a general risk statement and does not state a material weakness exists.

**Confidence:** HIGH (because “material weakness” identification is not stated anywhere in the provided text; only a general risk statement about needing further development is included).

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The excerpt appears to be only a portion of the full S-4/A; the full filing may include management’s report on ICFR, auditor reports, or additional risk factor detail that is not present in the provided document text (Table of Contents references to sections that are not included here, e.g., “Risk Factors” starting at page 31).
