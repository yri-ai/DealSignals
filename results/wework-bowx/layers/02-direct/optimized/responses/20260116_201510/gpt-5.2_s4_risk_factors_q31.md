Post-merger (i.e., “immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination”), **New WeWork’s board is expected to have nine directors**:

1. Marcelo Claure  
2. Michel Combes  
3. Bruce Dunlevie  
4. Véronique Laury  
5. Sandeep Mathrani  
6. Deven Parekh  
7. Vivek Ranadivé  
8. Kirthiga Reddy  
9. Jeff Sine  

**Citations:** “Questions and Answers for Stockholders of BowX — *Who will be the officers and directors of New WeWork if the Business Combination is consummated?*” (Q&A section, page xxii); also “Management of New WeWork Following the Business Combination” is referenced as the detailed section for management/board (Q&A section, page xxii).

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The document states what the Merger Agreement “provides” and what is “expected” post-closing, which implies the composition is contingent on consummation of the Business Combination and effective election at Closing. (Q&A section, page xxii)  

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly stated).
