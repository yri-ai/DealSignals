## Voting structure post‑merger (New WeWork)

- **Two classes of common stock:** Post‑Closing, BowX will rename to “WeWork Inc.” (“New WeWork”) and have **Class A common stock** and **Class C common stock** (plus preferred stock authorized). This is described in the “NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING…” under **Organizational Documents Proposal A** and repeated in the **Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus** under “Proposals to be Put to the Stockholders…” (pp. i–ii; Summary section “Proposals…”, p. 9). **[Confidence: HIGH]**

- **Class C is a voting-only, non-economic security:** The document states that New WeWork **Class C common stock is “a non-economic voting security without rights to dividends or on liquidation.”** (Organizational Documents Proposal A, pp. i–ii; Summary “Proposals…”, p. 9; also in “Selected Definitions” for “New WeWork Class C Common Stock,” p. xii). **[Confidence: HIGH]**

- **SoftBank voting cap for at least two years:** For votes or elections submitted to stockholders, **SoftBank Holders are restricted (for at least two years) from exercising voting rights over more than 49.9% of the voting securities present and voting at any stockholder meeting.** (Organizational Documents Proposal B, pp. i–ii; Summary “Proposals…”, p. 9). **[Confidence: HIGH]**

- **No explicit per‑share vote ratio stated:** The document describes that Class C is voting-only and that SoftBank voting is capped, but it **does not specify** the exact **votes per share** for Class A or Class C (e.g., 1 vote/share vs. multi‑vote) or whether they vote together as a single class on all matters. **Not found in document** (in the provided excerpt). **[Confidence: HIGH for “not found”]**

## Caveats / limitations
- The excerpt references the **Proposed Charter** (Annex B) and **Proposed Bylaws** (Annex C), which likely contain the detailed vote-per-share mechanics, but those annex texts are **not included in the provided document excerpt**, so the precise voting power per share cannot be confirmed here. (Table of Contents shows Annex B/C exist, p. vii). **[Confidence: HIGH]**
