The document describes **“Lock-Up Agreements”** as agreements entered into **in connection with the Business Combination** by **the Sponsor, certain BowX officers, certain WeWork officers, and certain WeWork stockholders**. Under these agreements, the parties agree that, for the applicable **Lock-Up Period** (defined elsewhere as **one year or nine months**, depending on the agreement), they will not: **(a)** sell or otherwise dispose of (or agree to do so), directly or indirectly, any shares of **New WeWork Common Stock** they hold immediately after Closing (“Lock-Up Shares”); **(b)** enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of those Lock-Up Shares; or **(c)** publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction described in (a) or (b). *(Section: “Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus — Related Agreements — Lock-Up Agreement,” p. 6; see also “Selected Definitions — ‘Lock-Up Agreements’ / ‘Lock-Up Period’ / ‘Lock-Up Shares’,” p. xii.)*

**Not found in document:** The document excerpt does not provide the *full text* of the Lock-Up Agreements (e.g., specific release triggers, exceptions, or which parties are subject to the one-year vs. nine-month period). *(Caveat based on the provided excerpt; “Lock-Up Period” only defined generally, p. xii.)*

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly stated description of the Lock-Up Agreements’ restrictions and parties).
