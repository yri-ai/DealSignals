### 2) PIPE Subscription Agreements – registration rights for PIPE Investors (non-Anchor PIPE Investors)

- **Effectiveness deadline (commercially reasonable efforts)**: BowX must use commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective **as soon as practicable**, but **no later than the earlier of**:
  - **60 calendar days** after filing (or **90 calendar days** if the SEC notifies BowX it will “review” the registration statement), or
  - the **10th business day** after BowX is notified by the SEC that the registration statement will not be reviewed or not subject to further review. (Section: **“PIPE Subscription Agreements”**, p. **5**)
- **How long it must remain effective**: Until the earliest of:
  - the date the PIPE Investors no longer hold registrable shares,
  - the date the shares can be sold without restriction under Rule 144 (and without needing current public information conditions under Rule 144(c)(1) or Rule 144(i)(2)), or
  - **three years** from the date of effectiveness of the registration statement. (Section: **“PIPE Subscription Agreements”**, p. **5**)

## Caveats / limitations
- The document describes these registration rights at a summary level and notes they are **“subject to certain limitations”** in the governing agreement(s), but those limitations are not detailed in the excerpt provided. (Section: **“Related Agreements — Registration Rights Agreement”**, p. **5**)

## Confidence
**HIGH** — The existence and key terms of the registration rights are directly stated in the cited sections (p. 5).
