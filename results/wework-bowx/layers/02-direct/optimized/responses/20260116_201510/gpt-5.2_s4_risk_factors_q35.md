## Market context at deal time (as described in the document)

- **COVID-19-driven disruption and uncertainty in office demand.** The document states that the COVID-19 pandemic “had a significant impact” on WeWork’s business and created uncertainty about the duration and extent of impacts, including due to virus variants and government restrictions. It also notes COVID-19 negatively affected demand (e.g., reduced new sales volume, member churn/non-payment, delayed openings). (Section: **“RISK FACTORS — The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact…”**, pp. **31–32**)

- **Shift toward flexible workspaces / remote and hybrid work considerations.** The document explains that even after restrictions are lifted, WeWork’s business could be adversely impacted because customers are “deferring return-to-office plans” and “considering remote and hybrid office space arrangements.” (Section: **“RISK FACTORS — The COVID-19 pandemic…”**, p. **32**)

- **Commercial real estate market pressure / excess supply affecting pricing.** The document says WeWork “experienced and may continue to experience pricing challenges… due to an excess supply of commercial real estate available” as companies defer return-to-office plans and consider remote/hybrid models. (Section: **“RISK FACTORS — The COVID-19 pandemic…”**, p. **32**)

- **BowX market pricing immediately before deal announcement.** As market reference points, BowX securities closed the last trading day before announcement (March 25, 2021) at: Units **$9.98**, Class A common **$9.73**, and public warrants **$1.07**. (Section: **“MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION”**, p. **30**)

- **No public market for WeWork securities at deal time.** The document notes that historical market price information for WeWork is not provided because “there is no public market for WeWork’s securities.” (Section: **“MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION — Price Range of WeWork’s Securities”**, p. **30**)

## Confidence rating
**HIGH** — all points are directly stated in the cited sections.

## Caveats / limitations
- The document describes **macro/industry context primarily through risk factor disclosures** (COVID-19, office demand changes, pricing pressure), but it **does not provide broader equity market/SPAC market conditions** (e.g., SPAC issuance trends, interest rate regime, valuation comps) beyond BowX’s trading prices and the general COVID/CRE narrative. (See **pp. 30–32**, sections cited above)
