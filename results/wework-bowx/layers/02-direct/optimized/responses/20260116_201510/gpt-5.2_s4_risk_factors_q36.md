**Not found in document.** The provided excerpt includes sections such as **“SUMMARY OF THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS”** and related subsections (e.g., **“BowX’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Business Combination”**) and **“RISK FACTORS”**, but it does **not** disclose any **comparable transactions** (e.g., precedent M&A / SPAC deals, comps multiples, or a comps analysis). (See **Table of Contents** listing and **Summary** discussion beginning **p. 1**, and **Risk Factors** beginning **p. 31**.)

**Confidence:** HIGH (explicitly absent from provided document text)

**Caveat / limitation:** This conclusion is limited to the portion of the filing provided in the prompt; if comparable transactions are discussed elsewhere in the full S-4/A (e.g., in a fairness discussion or valuation section), that content is not included here.
