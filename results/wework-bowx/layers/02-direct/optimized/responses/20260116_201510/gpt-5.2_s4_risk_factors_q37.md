## Exit/refinancing strategy for lease obligations

**Not found in document** with respect to a specific, articulated “exit/refinancing strategy” (e.g., a defined refinancing plan for lease obligations or a formal strategy for refinancing lease-related liabilities).

What the document *does* describe are **portfolio optimization / lease exit actions** rather than a refinancing plan:

- WeWork’s strategy includes **optimizing its real estate portfolio**, which has involved **negotiating lease amendments and/or exits** to reduce future lease payments and lease security requirements. Specifically, as of June 30, 2021, WeWork and its joint venture partners had **negotiated over 500 lease amendments and/or exits**, resulting in an approximately **$6.9 billion reduction to future lease payments** and approximately **$1.1 billion reduction in total lease security** since December 31, 2019 (including ChinaCo prior to deconsolidation). (Risk Factors — “The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management…”)

- The document also notes WeWork may **withhold rent payments for some period of time** at certain locations as part of optimization efforts, and that this has led (in a small number of cases) to **litigation filed by landlords**. (Risk Factors — “The Company is undergoing a transformation in its business plan under new management…”)

- It highlights that WeWork’s leases generally **lack early termination provisions** and that WeWork may seek to mitigate unprofitable leases by **assignment, sublease, renegotiation, or exit**, though this can be constrained by lease transfer restrictions and may require inducements/costs. (Risk Factors — “The long-term and fixed-cost nature of the Company’s leases may limit the Company’s operating flexibility…”)

### Caveats / limitations
- The disclosures focus on **operational lease restructuring/exits** and associated risks, but **do not lay out a formal refinancing strategy** for lease obligations (e.g., refinancing lease liabilities with debt, securitization, or other structured financing). (Not found in document; see citations above for related but different content)

**Confidence: HIGH** (the absence of an explicit refinancing/exit “strategy” is based on the provided text; related lease-exit activities are directly stated in the cited sections).
