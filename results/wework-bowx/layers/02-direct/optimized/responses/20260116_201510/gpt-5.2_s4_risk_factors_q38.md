## Planned post‑merger integration / business model changes (per document)

1) **Corporate structure and name change to “New WeWork”**
- After Closing, BowX intended to change its name to **WeWork Inc.** (“New WeWork”). (Cover letter; “In connection with the Closing…BowX intends to change its name to WeWork Inc.”)  
- Transaction integration structure: Merger Sub merges into WeWork (WeWork survives as a BowX subsidiary), then WeWork (as the surviving corporation) merges into Merger Sub II (Merger Sub II survives). (Cover letter describing “First Merger” and “Second Merger”)  

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly stated)  
**Caveat:** The document describes legal structure but provides limited operational integration detail beyond governance/financing.  

2) **Board and management transition**
- Post‑Closing, BowX’s officers and directors (except Vivek Ranadivé) would resign, and New WeWork would have a specified nine‑member board and named executive officers. (“Questions and Answers…Who will be the officers and directors of New WeWork…”, including statement that BowX officers/directors other than Ranadivé will resign)  

**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Caveat:** Transition is stated at a personnel level; no detailed functional integration plan is provided.  

3) **Strategic business model shift (WeWork transformation plan)**
The document states WeWork was already undergoing a transformation and describes planned strategy going forward (which would become the operating model of New WeWork):

- **Focus on profitability (positive Adjusted EBITDA) via expense management and streamlined operations**, rather than rapid growth. (Risk Factors: “The Company is undergoing a transformation…new strategic plan emphasizes achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA through expense management and streamlined operations…”)  
- **Optimize the existing real estate portfolio** (global review of locations, lease amendments/exits) and execute on the **current pipeline** before pursuing additional growth opportunities. (Risk Factors: “…focusing on optimizing the Company’s existing real estate portfolio…executing well on its current pipeline…before seeking growth opportunities.”)  
- **Pursue more “asset‑light” structures** beyond traditional long-term leasing, including **management agreements, participating leases, regional joint ventures, and other occupancy arrangements with variable rent**. (Risk Factors: “increasingly pursuing strategic alternatives to pure leasing arrangements…” and separately: “pursue additional joint ventures…management agreements and alternative deal structures with variable rent.”)  
- **Develop a regional joint venture model / localized market-driven models**, including licensing WeWork technology/services and leveraging the customer base to operators/landlords. (Risk Factors: “strategic business plan includes…development of a regional joint venture model…” and description of licensing model)  
- **Platform business opportunity**: WeWork was developing a platform to allow landlords/operators to power/manage flexible space in their portfolios. (Summary: “Platform Business Opportunity…developing a platform…to offer landlords and operators the ability to power and manage flexible spaces…”)  

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly stated across Summary and Risk Factors)  
**Caveats / limitations:**
- The document frames these as strategy/intent and includes explicit uncertainty that the new strategy “may not be successful.” (Risk Factors: “there can be no assurances that this new business strategy will be successful.”)  
- No specific timeline, milestones, cost synergies, or integration KPIs are provided in the excerpted text.  

4) **Use of proceeds to support operations and growth initiatives**
- The cash from BowX trust and the PIPE was expected to be used after Closing to **fund existing operations and support new and existing growth initiatives**. (Summary: “Use of Proceeds…expected to be used…to fund WeWork’s existing operations and support new and existing growth initiatives.”)  

**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Caveat:** High-level use of proceeds only; not broken down into detailed post‑merger operating initiatives in the provided text.
