**What is present (related, but not a list of debt covenants/restrictions):**
- The document defines and describes certain **debt facilities/arrangements** (e.g., “Company Credit Agreement,” “2020 LC Facility,” “SoftBank Senior Secured Notes/Amended Senior Secured Notes”) in the **“Selected Definitions”** section and **“Related Agreements—Credit Support Letter / Commitment Letter for Secured Notes”** summary, but **does not disclose the specific covenant package** (e.g., leverage ratios, liquidity covenants, restricted payments, negative pledges, etc.) in the provided excerpt. (Sections: “SELECTED DEFINITIONS”; “Related Agreements—Credit Support Letter”; “Commitment Letter for Secured Notes”)
- In **Risk Factors**, the document states generally that **WeWork’s debt facilities impose or may impose restrictions on distributions** and that **terms of indebtedness restrict current and future operations**, but **without detailing the specific covenants**. (Sections: “Risk Factors”; “Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Condition”; also “Selected Definitions” referencing “Company Credit Agreement”)

**Caveat / limitation:** The provided document excerpt appears incomplete relative to the full S-4/A; detailed debt covenants are often found in MD&A, risk factor subsections on indebtedness, or in credit agreement exhibits—none of which are included with covenant detail in the text provided here.

**Confidence:** HIGH (the excerpt contains only general statements and no detailed covenant terms).
