Not found in document.

**Caveat / limitation:** The document is a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus (Form S‑4/A) that provides transaction terms, ownership dilution examples, selected historical financials, and extensive risk factors (e.g., “Risk Factors” starting on page 31; “Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus” starting on page 1; “Selected Historical Financial Information of WeWork” on page 23; “Selected Historical Financial Information of BowX” on page 21). However, it does **not** contain an explicit investment recommendation tailored to an investor (e.g., “we recommend you invest” / “do not invest”), nor does it provide a complete investor-specific mandate (risk tolerance, time horizon, required return) necessary to answer “would you invest” solely from the text.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document does not state whether to invest; any “yes/no” would require assumptions beyond the document).
