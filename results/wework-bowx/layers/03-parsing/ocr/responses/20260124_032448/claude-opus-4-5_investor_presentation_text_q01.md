## Analysis

After carefully reviewing the entire document, I was unable to find WeWork's revenue for the most recent reported period.

**Finding:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork presentation or pitch deck from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited actual content. The document consists primarily of:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on each page
- Bullet point markers (•, ●, ○) without accompanying text
- Company values/mission statements (Page 10)
- Product description for "All Access" offering (Page 25)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)

No financial figures, revenue data, or specific numerical performance metrics are visible in the parsed content.

**Caveats/Limitations:**
- The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this document, particularly any charts, tables, or financial figures that would typically be included in a SPAC merger presentation
- The actual slides likely contained financial information that was not successfully extracted

**Confidence:** N/A - Information not present in the available document content.

**Recommendation:** Request the original document file or a properly parsed version to access financial data for due diligence purposes.
