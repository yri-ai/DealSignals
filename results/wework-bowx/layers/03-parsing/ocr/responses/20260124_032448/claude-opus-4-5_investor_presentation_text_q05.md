## Analysis: Cash Runway at Current Burn Rate

**Answer: Not found in document**

The provided document does not contain the necessary information to determine the cash runway at current burn rate. Specifically, the document lacks:

1. **Cash and cash equivalents balance** - No figures are provided showing the company's current cash position
2. **Burn rate data** - No monthly or quarterly cash burn figures are presented
3. **Operating expenses or cash flow statements** - The actual financial data appears to be missing from the OCR parsing

### Document Assessment

The OCR-parsed document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the parsing has captured primarily:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers (•, ●, ○) without the associated text content
- Some qualitative corporate values statements (Page 10)
- Product description for "All Access" offering (Page 25)
- A timeline reference spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)

The actual financial data, charts, and numerical content that would typically be present in a SPAC merger due diligence document have not been captured in this OCR output.

### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not present)

### Caveats and Limitations

1. **OCR Quality Issue**: The document appears to have significant OCR parsing failures - most pages show only confidentiality footers and bullet symbols without substantive content
2. **Missing Financial Data**: Key financial metrics required for this analysis are not visible in the parsed text
3. **Incomplete Document**: The document structure suggests there should be financial projections and metrics, but these have not been successfully extracted

**Recommendation**: Request a higher-quality OCR parse or the original source document to conduct proper due diligence analysis on cash runway.
