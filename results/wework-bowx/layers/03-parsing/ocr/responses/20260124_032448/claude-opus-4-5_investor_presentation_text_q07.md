## Analysis: Key Assumptions Underlying the Projections

**Not found in document.**

Based on my review of the provided OCR-parsed document, I cannot identify the specific key assumptions underlying WeWork's projections. The document appears to be a confidential 2021 WeWork presentation (likely an investor deck for the SPAC merger), but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content:

### What the document contains:
- **Page 10**: Company values/culture statements about integrity, collaboration, and community
- **Page 24**: A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (likely a visual/chart, but no data captured)
- **Page 25**: Description of "All Access" product features (on-demand subscriptions, partnerships, occupancy drivers, high margins)
- **Pages 45-46**: Bullet point indicators suggesting definitions or methodology sections (possibly non-GAAP reconciliations based on terms like "divided by")

### Critical Limitation:
The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture the actual text, data, and figures from most pages. The document shows only:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers (•, ●, ○) without accompanying text
- Scattered fragments

### What would typically be expected:
A SPAC merger presentation would normally include assumptions regarding:
- Revenue growth rates
- Occupancy/utilization rates
- Member retention/churn
- Pricing assumptions
- Geographic expansion plans
- Cost structure and margin improvements
- Capital expenditure requirements

**Confidence Level: N/A** - Cannot assess assumptions that are not legible in the document.

**Recommendation:** Request a properly parsed version of this document or the original PDF to conduct meaningful due diligence on projection assumptions.
