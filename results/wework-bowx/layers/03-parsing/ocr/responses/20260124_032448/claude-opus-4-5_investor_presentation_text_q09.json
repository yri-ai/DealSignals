While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 (likely related to a SPAC merger based on the context), the OCR-parsed content is extremely limited and does not include:\n- Revenue figures\n- Desk/workstation counts\n- Any calculated metric for revenue per desk/workstation\n\n### What the Document Does Contain:\nThe legible content is primarily:\n- **Page 10**: Company values/mission statements about integrity, collaboration, community\n- **Page 24**: A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (no associated data visible)\n- **Page 25**: Description of \"All Access\" product - a subscription/pay-as-you-go model that \"drives occupancy\" and has \"high margins\" - but no specific revenue metrics\n- **Page 45-46**: Appears to reference financial definitions/metrics (bullet points visible but text not captured)\n\n### Caveats and Limitations:\n1. **Severe OCR quality issues**: The vast majority of pages contain only copyright notices and bullet point symbols with no actual text content\n2. The document appears to be a slide presentation where images, charts, and key financial data were not captured by the OCR process\n3. Pages 45-46 appear to contain financial definitions that might include this metric, but the text was not extracted\n\n### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not available in document)\n\n### Recommendation:\nRequest a properly parsed version of this document or the original PDF, as critical financial data appears to be missing from this OCR output.",
