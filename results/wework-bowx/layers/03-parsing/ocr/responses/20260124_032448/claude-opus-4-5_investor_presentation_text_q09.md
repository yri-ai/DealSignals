## Analysis: Revenue Per Available Desk/Workstation

### Answer:
**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain specific information about revenue per available desk or workstation. While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 (likely related to a SPAC merger based on the context), the OCR-parsed content is extremely limited and does not include:
- Revenue figures
- Desk/workstation counts
- Any calculated metric for revenue per desk/workstation

### What the Document Does Contain:
The legible content is primarily:
- **Page 10**: Company values/mission statements about integrity, collaboration, community
- **Page 24**: A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (no associated data visible)
- **Page 25**: Description of "All Access" product - a subscription/pay-as-you-go model that "drives occupancy" and has "high margins" - but no specific revenue metrics
- **Page 45-46**: Appears to reference financial definitions/metrics (bullet points visible but text not captured)

### Caveats and Limitations:
1. **Severe OCR quality issues**: The vast majority of pages contain only copyright notices and bullet point symbols with no actual text content
2. The document appears to be a slide presentation where images, charts, and key financial data were not captured by the OCR process
3. Pages 45-46 appear to contain financial definitions that might include this metric, but the text was not extracted

### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not available in document)

### Recommendation:
Request a properly parsed version of this document or the original PDF, as critical financial data appears to be missing from this OCR output.
