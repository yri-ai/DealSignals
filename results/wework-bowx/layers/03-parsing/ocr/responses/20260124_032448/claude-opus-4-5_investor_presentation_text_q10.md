## Analysis: Occupancy Rate and Trends

### Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain specific occupancy rate figures or historical occupancy trend data. While the document references occupancy conceptually on **Page 25**, which discusses the "All Access" product and states it "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections," this is a description of a product feature rather than actual occupancy metrics or historical trends.

### What the Document Does Contain

**Page 25** mentions occupancy in the context of the "All Access" subscription product:
- "Drives Occupancy: Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections"

This indicates WeWork has a strategy to maximize occupancy through subscription-based access, but no specific percentages, historical data, or trend information is provided.

### Caveats and Limitations

1. **OCR Quality Issues**: The document appears to have significant OCR parsing problems, with many pages showing only copyright notices and bullet points without substantive content
2. **Missing Data**: Key financial metrics, charts, and detailed text appear to be missing from the parsed output
3. **Incomplete Information**: Page 24 shows a timeline (2010-2030) that likely contained relevant data or charts that were not captured in the OCR

### Confidence Level

**LOW** - The document in its current parsed form does not provide the requested information. The actual presentation likely contained occupancy data that was not captured by the OCR process.

### Recommendation

Request the original document or a better-quality OCR scan to obtain actual occupancy rate figures and trend data for proper due diligence analysis.
