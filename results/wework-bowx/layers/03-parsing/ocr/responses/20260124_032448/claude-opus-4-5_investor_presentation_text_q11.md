## Answer: Not found in document

The provided document does not contain any information about member churn rate. While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, the OCR-parsed content is extremely limited, showing mostly:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Bullet point markers without associated text
- Company values/mission statement (Page 10)
- A brief description of the "All Access" product (Page 25)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)

**Caveats and Limitations:**
- The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the actual content from this document
- Many pages show only bullet point symbols (•, ●, ○) without the accompanying text
- Page 45 references metrics definitions (including "divided by" suggesting ratio calculations), but the actual metric names and values were not captured
- The document likely contains financial and operational metrics that were not successfully extracted through OCR

**Confidence: N/A** - Cannot provide a confidence rating as the information is not present in the available document content.

**Recommendation:** Request a better quality OCR scan or the original source document to conduct proper due diligence on member churn metrics.
