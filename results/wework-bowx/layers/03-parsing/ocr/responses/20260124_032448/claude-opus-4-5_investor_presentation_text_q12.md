## Analysis: Average Revenue Per Member

**Answer: Not found in document**

The provided document does not contain any specific financial figures, metrics, or data regarding revenue per member. While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 (based on the copyright notices on each page), the OCR-parsed content consists almost entirely of:

1. Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
2. Empty bullet points (•, ●, ○)
3. Corporate values/mission statements (Page 10)
4. A product description for "All Access" service (Page 25) mentioning "High Margins" and "subscription-based model" but no actual figures
5. A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24) with no associated data

**Relevant but Insufficient Information:**
- Page 25 references "All Access" subscription products and mentions "High Margins" and "Significant incremental margins," but provides no quantitative revenue per member data.

**Confidence Level: N/A** (Information not present)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
- The OCR parsing appears to have captured very limited text content from what was likely a visually-rich presentation deck
- Most pages contain only structural elements (bullet points) without the associated text content
- Financial data, charts, and tables that may have been present in the original document are not reflected in the parsed text
- To answer this question, access to the complete, properly parsed document would be necessary
