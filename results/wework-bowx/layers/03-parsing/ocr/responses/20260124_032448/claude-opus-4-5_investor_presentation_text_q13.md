## Analysis: Total Lease Obligations

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** 

After reviewing all 50 pages of the provided OCR-parsed document, I cannot identify any specific figures or data regarding total lease obligations. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited content:

- Most pages contain only the copyright notice "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential."
- Some pages show bullet points (•, ●, ○) without accompanying text
- Page 10 contains company values/cultural statements
- Page 24 shows a timeline from 2010-2030 without specific data
- Page 25 describes an "All Access" subscription product
- Page 45 appears to reference some metrics (mentions "divided by") but no actual numbers are visible

**Confidence Level:** N/A (information not available)

**Caveats and Limitations:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this document, including any tables, charts, or numerical data
2. Key financial information such as lease obligations would typically appear in financial sections that are not readable in this parsed version
3. The document structure suggests there should be more content (given 50 pages), but it was not successfully extracted

**Recommendation:** Request a higher-quality scan or the original document to properly extract financial data including lease obligations, which would be critical information for SPAC merger due diligence given WeWork's business model heavily relies on lease commitments.
