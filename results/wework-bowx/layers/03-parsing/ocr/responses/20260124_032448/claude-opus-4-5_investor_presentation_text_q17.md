## Analysis: Business at 50% Occupancy

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain any specific information about what happens to the business at 50% occupancy. While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (based on the copyright notices on each page), the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content.

### Relevant Content Found:

The only occupancy-related content appears on **Page 25**, which mentions:
- "Drives Occupancy - Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections"

However, this does not address what occurs at a 50% occupancy threshold specifically.

### Limitations:

1. **Significant OCR parsing issues**: The document appears to be heavily image-based, with most pages showing only copyright notices and bullet point markers without the actual text content.

2. **Missing data**: Pages contain bullet points (•, ●, ○) but the accompanying text was not captured by the OCR.

3. **Page 24** shows a timeline from 2010-2030 but no associated data or metrics.

### Confidence Level: **N/A** (Information not present)

### Recommendation:

To properly answer this question, you would need:
- The original document with complete OCR parsing
- Financial projections showing break-even analysis
- Unit economics data at various occupancy levels

The document likely contains this information in the unparsed visual elements, but it cannot be analyzed from the current extraction.
