## Analysis: Implied Enterprise Value

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** After reviewing all 50 pages of the provided OCR-parsed document, I was unable to locate any specific enterprise value figure, valuation metrics, or financial data that would allow me to identify or calculate the implied enterprise value for this SPAC merger.

**Document Limitations:**
The OCR parsing appears to have captured very limited content from what seems to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021. The document primarily contains:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on every page
- Bullet point placeholders (•, ●, ○) without associated text
- Company values/mission statement text (Page 10)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)
- Description of "All Access" subscription product features (Page 25)
- Various section markers but missing the substantive financial data

**Confidence Level:** N/A (information not present)

**Caveats:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this presentation, including any financial tables, charts, or valuation information that would typically be present in a SPAC merger investor deck.
2. Enterprise value information would typically be found in sections covering transaction overview, valuation summary, or pro forma capitalization, none of which are legibly present in this parsed document.
3. To properly answer this question, a higher-quality OCR scan or the original document would be needed.
