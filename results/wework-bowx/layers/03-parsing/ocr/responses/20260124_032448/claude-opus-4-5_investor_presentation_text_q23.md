## Analysis of Related-Party Transactions

**Answer:** Not found in document.

### Explanation:

After reviewing all 50 pages of the provided OCR-parsed document, I could not locate any information regarding related-party transactions. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content:

- **Pages 1-9, 11-14, 16-21, 26-36, 38-44, 47-50:** Contain only the copyright notice "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." and occasionally bullet point symbols without text
- **Page 10:** Contains company values/mission statement language
- **Page 24:** Shows a timeline from 2010-2030
- **Page 25:** Describes the "All Access" product offering
- **Page 45-46:** Contains bullet points and formatting symbols but no readable text about transactions

### Caveats and Limitations:

1. **OCR Quality Issues:** The document appears to have significant OCR parsing failures, with most pages showing only copyright notices and empty bullet points, suggesting graphics, tables, or other content that did not parse properly.

2. **Missing Content:** Given that this appears to be a SPAC merger presentation, related-party transaction disclosures would typically be included but may have been in sections that failed to parse (charts, tables, or graphical elements).

3. **Recommendation:** To properly assess related-party transactions, I would recommend:
   - Obtaining a clean PDF version of this document
   - Reviewing the S-4/DEFM14A SEC filing for the merger
   - Examining the proxy statement which would have required related-party disclosures

**Confidence Level:** N/A (information not available in document)
