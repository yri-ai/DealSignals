  "content": "## Analysis: Going Concern Disclosures\n\n**Answer:** Not found in document.\n\n**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (dated 2021), but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content. The document consists primarily of:\n\n- Copyright notices (\"\u00a9 2021 WeWork. Confidential.\") on each page\n- Bullet point markers without associated text\n- A timeline reference on Page 24 (2010-2030)\n- Corporate values/culture statements on Page 10\n- Product description for \"All Access\" subscription model on Page 25\n- Some partial text fragments on Pages 45-46\n\nThe document does not contain any visible going concern disclosures, auditor opinions, or financial statement footnotes that would typically address going concern matters. Going concern disclosures are typically found in:\n- Audited financial statements\n- Auditor's reports\n- Notes to financial statements\n- Risk factors sections\n\nNone of these appear in the captured text of this document.\n\n**Confidence Level:** LOW\n\n**Caveats/Limitations:**\n1. The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this presentation\n2. This appears to be a marketing/investor presentation rather than audited financial statements where going concern disclosures would typically appear\n3. The bullet points visible throughout suggest significant content was not captured by the OCR process\n4. A complete going concern analysis would require access to WeWork's audited financial statements and SEC filings (such as the S-4/proxy statement for the SPAC merger)",
