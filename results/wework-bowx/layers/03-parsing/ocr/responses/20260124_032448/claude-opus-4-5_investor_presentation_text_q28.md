## Analysis: Going Concern Disclosures

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation (dated 2021), but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content. The document consists primarily of:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on each page
- Bullet point markers without associated text
- A timeline reference on Page 24 (2010-2030)
- Corporate values/culture statements on Page 10
- Product description for "All Access" subscription model on Page 25
- Some partial text fragments on Pages 45-46

The document does not contain any visible going concern disclosures, auditor opinions, or financial statement footnotes that would typically address going concern matters. Going concern disclosures are typically found in:
- Audited financial statements
- Auditor's reports
- Notes to financial statements
- Risk factors sections

None of these appear in the captured text of this document.

**Confidence Level:** LOW

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this presentation
2. This appears to be a marketing/investor presentation rather than audited financial statements where going concern disclosures would typically appear
3. The bullet points visible throughout suggest significant content was not captured by the OCR process
4. A complete going concern analysis would require access to WeWork's audited financial statements and SEC filings (such as the S-4/proxy statement for the SPAC merger)
