## Analysis: Board Composition Post-Merger

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** The provided document appears to be a WeWork presentation from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp.), but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content. The document consists primarily of:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on every page
- Bullet point markers without accompanying text
- Company values/mission statement on Page 10
- A brief description of the "All Access" subscription product on Page 25
- A timeline graphic reference on Page 24

**No information regarding board composition post-merger** is present in the parsed content, including:
- Number of board seats
- Names of proposed directors
- Board committee structure
- Independence requirements
- Investor representation rights

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (that the information is not present in the provided document text)

**Caveats and Limitations:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the substantive content from this presentation - only headers, footers, and bullet markers were extracted
2. The actual slides likely contained financial data, organizational charts, and governance information that was not captured
3. Board composition details are typically found in merger proxy statements (DEF 14A) or S-4 registration statements rather than investor presentations
4. To properly answer this question, the full merger documentation would need to be reviewed with proper OCR extraction
