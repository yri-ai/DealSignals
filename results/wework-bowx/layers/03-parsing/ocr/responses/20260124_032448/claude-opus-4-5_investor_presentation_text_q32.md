## Analysis: Voting Structure Post-Merger

### Answer

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain any information regarding the voting structure post-merger. The OCR-parsed content shows that most pages contain only:
- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.")
- Empty bullet points
- A timeline visual reference (Page 24)
- Company values/mission statements (Page 10)
- Product description for "All Access" offering (Page 25)
- Various bullet point placeholders without actual content

There is no discussion of:
- Share class structures
- Voting rights per share
- Founder/sponsor voting arrangements
- Any governance provisions related to shareholder voting

### Confidence Level
**N/A** - Information is not present in the document.

### Caveats and Limitations
1. **Significant OCR Quality Issues**: The document appears to have substantial OCR parsing problems, with most pages showing only copyright footers and empty bullet points, suggesting images, charts, or formatted text were not captured.
2. **Document Type**: This appears to be a confidential WeWork presentation (likely an investor deck), which may not be the appropriate source document for voting structure details. Such information would typically be found in:
   - Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A)
   - Form S-4 Registration Statement
   - Merger Agreement exhibits

### Recommendation
To answer this question, please provide the SPAC merger proxy statement, Form S-4, or the merger agreement documentation where voting structure details would be disclosed.
