  "content": "## Analysis of Lock-up Agreements\n\n**Answer:** Not found in document.\n\n**Explanation:** \nI have thoroughly reviewed all 50 pages of the provided OCR-parsed document. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited text content. The visible content includes:\n\n- Copyright notices (\"\u00a9 2021 WeWork. Confidential.\") on every page\n- Company values/mission statements (Page 10)\n- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)\n- Description of an \"All Access\" subscription product (Page 25)\n- Various bullet points without their associated text content\n- Some definitions or metric explanations (Page 45-46)\n\nHowever, there is **no mention of lock-up agreements** anywhere in the document. Lock-up agreements typically specify:\n- The duration shareholders must hold shares post-merger\n- Which parties are subject to the lock-up\n- Any early release provisions\n- Volume restrictions after lock-up expiration\n\nNone of this information appears in the provided document text.\n\n**Confidence Level:** HIGH (that the information is not present in the document)\n\n**Caveats/Limitations:**\n1. The OCR parsing appears to have missed substantial content from the original document - many pages show only bullet point markers without the actual text\n2. The lock-up agreement details may exist in the full presentation but were not captured by the OCR process\n3. Lock-up terms are often found in separate legal documents (merger agreements, registration statements) rather than investor presentations",
