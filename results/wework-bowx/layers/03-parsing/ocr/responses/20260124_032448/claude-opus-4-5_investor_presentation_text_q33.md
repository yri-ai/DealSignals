## Analysis of Lock-up Agreements

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** 
I have thoroughly reviewed all 50 pages of the provided OCR-parsed document. The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited text content. The visible content includes:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on every page
- Company values/mission statements (Page 10)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)
- Description of an "All Access" subscription product (Page 25)
- Various bullet points without their associated text content
- Some definitions or metric explanations (Page 45-46)

However, there is **no mention of lock-up agreements** anywhere in the document. Lock-up agreements typically specify:
- The duration shareholders must hold shares post-merger
- Which parties are subject to the lock-up
- Any early release provisions
- Volume restrictions after lock-up expiration

None of this information appears in the provided document text.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (that the information is not present in the document)

**Caveats/Limitations:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have missed substantial content from the original document - many pages show only bullet point markers without the actual text
2. The lock-up agreement details may exist in the full presentation but were not captured by the OCR process
3. Lock-up terms are often found in separate legal documents (merger agreements, registration statements) rather than investor presentations
