## Analysis: Market Context at Deal Time

**Not found in document.**

The provided document does not contain specific information about the market context at the time of the deal. While the document appears to be a 2021 WeWork confidential presentation (likely related to their SPAC merger with BowX Acquisition Corp), the OCR-parsed content shows:

- Copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") on every page
- Company values/mission statements (Page 10)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)
- Product description for "All Access" offering (Page 25) mentioning subscription models and occupancy drivers
- Various bullet points throughout without corresponding text content

**Key Limitations:**
1. The OCR parsing appears to have captured very limited actual text content
2. Most pages show only the copyright footer and bullet point markers without the substantive content
3. No market data, industry trends, competitive landscape, or economic conditions are visible in the parsed text

**Confidence Level: N/A** - Cannot provide an answer as the necessary information is not present in the document.

**Recommendation:** Request a higher-quality OCR scan or the original source document to extract market context information that may exist in headers, charts, or body text that was not captured in this parsing.
