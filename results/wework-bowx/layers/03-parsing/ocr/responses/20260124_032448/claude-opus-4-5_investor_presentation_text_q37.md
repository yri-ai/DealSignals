## Analysis: Exit/Refinancing Strategy for Lease Obligations

**Answer: Not found in document.**

After thoroughly reviewing all 50 pages of this OCR-parsed document, I cannot identify any specific information regarding WeWork's exit or refinancing strategy for their lease obligations. 

### Document Limitations:

The document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021, but the OCR parsing has captured very limited substantive content:

- **Pages 1-9, 11-14, 16-21, 26, 28-36, 38-44, 47-50**: Contain only copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") and bullet point markers with no text
- **Page 10**: Contains company values/mission statements only
- **Page 24**: Shows a timeline from 2010-2030 with no context
- **Page 25**: Describes the "All Access" subscription product features (pay-as-you-go model, partnerships, occupancy, margins)
- **Pages 45-46**: Contain bullet points and sub-bullets but no readable text content

### What Would Be Expected:

For a SPAC merger due diligence document, an exit/refinancing strategy for lease obligations would typically include:
- Lease restructuring terms
- Sale-leaseback arrangements
- Lease termination provisions
- Refinancing timelines and conditions
- Liability management approaches

None of this information is present in the readable portions of this document.

**Confidence Level: HIGH** (that the information is not present in this document)

**Caveat:** The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the actual content from this presentation. The original document may contain this information, but it is not accessible in the provided text.
