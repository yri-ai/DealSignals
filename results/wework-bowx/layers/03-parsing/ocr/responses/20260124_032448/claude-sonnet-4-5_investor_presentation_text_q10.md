# Analysis of Occupancy Rate and Trends

## Answer:

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:

While the document does reference occupancy in a strategic context, it does not provide:

1. **Specific occupancy rate figures** - No percentages or numerical metrics are stated
2. **Historical trend data** - No time series or comparative data showing how occupancy has changed over time

## What the Document Does Contain:

**Page 25** mentions occupancy in the context of WeWork's "All Access" product strategy:
- "Drives Occupancy: Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections"

This describes a strategic capability rather than actual occupancy performance metrics.

## Confidence Level: 

**HIGH** - I am confident this information is not present in the document. The OCR-parsed content contains mostly copyright notices and limited strategic/qualitative information, but lacks financial metrics, operational KPIs, or trend data.

## Caveats:

- The document appears to be a heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed presentation
- Most pages contain only "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential." with occasional bullet points or brief text fragments
- Financial and operational metrics that would typically appear in a SPAC due diligence document are not visible in this version
