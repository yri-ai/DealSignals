# Answer: Member Churn Rate

**Not found in document.**

## Search Conducted:
I searched the document for:
- The term "churn" or "churn rate"
- The term "member churn"
- Any metrics related to member retention or attrition
- Page 45, which contains multiple metric definitions (indicated by bullet points and colons suggesting definitions)
- Page 46, which also contains bullet-pointed information that might include metric definitions

## Findings:
While the document discusses various aspects of WeWork's business model, including:
- Member-related information (Pages 10, 25)
- Business metrics and definitions (Pages 45-46, indicated by bullet point structures)
- Occupancy metrics (Page 25)

**No specific definition or value for "member churn rate" is legible or present in the provided OCR-parsed content.**

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The absence of this information is stated with high confidence because:
1. The document text is largely unreadable (mostly showing only copyright notices and bullet points without content)
2. A thorough search of all pages did not reveal the term "churn"
3. Even pages that appear to contain metric definitions (45-46) do not have readable content that includes churn rate

## Caveat:
The OCR parsing appears to have failed to capture most of the actual text content, rendering only headers, copyright notices, and structural elements (bullets, page numbers) visible. The information may exist in the original document but is not accessible in this parsed version.
