# Analysis: Average Revenue Per Member

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

The document provided consists primarily of presentation slides with copyright notices and limited visible content. While the document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021, the specific financial metric "average revenue per member" is not stated in the available text.

## What Was Found

- **Page 25**: Describes WeWork's "All Access" product model mentioning it "Generates Partnerships," "Drives Occupancy," and has "High Margins" with a "subscription-based model," but provides no specific revenue or member metrics.

- **Page 45**: Contains bullet points that appear to reference various metrics (indicated by multiple "●" symbols), with one mentioning "divided by" which could suggest ratio calculations, but the actual text/numbers are not visible in the OCR output.

## Confidence Level

**N/A** - The information is not present in the document as provided.

## Caveats

1. The OCR parsing appears incomplete, with most pages showing only copyright notices
2. Many pages contain bullet points (●) without accompanying text, suggesting content may not have been properly captured
3. If this metric exists in the original presentation, it was not successfully extracted in the OCR process
