While the document appears to be a WeWork confidential presentation from 2021 (likely related to their SPAC merger), the OCR parsing has resulted in most content being stripped out, leaving primarily copyright notices and bullet points without accompanying text.\n\nThe document does not contain any specific financial information about total lease obligations. There are no financial tables, balance sheet data, or specific liability figures visible in the parsed text provided.\n\n## Caveats:\n\n1. **OCR Quality Issue**: The document appears to be heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed, with most substantive content missing. Only headers, copyright notices, and bullet point markers are visible.\n\n2. **Missing Financial Data**: No financial statements, footnotes, or detailed metrics are present in the parsed version that would typically contain lease obligation information.\n\n3. **Document Type**: This appears to be an investor presentation rather than a detailed financial disclosure document where lease obligations would typically be itemized.\n\nTo answer this question accurately, a properly parsed version of the document with visible financial data would be required.",
