# Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

The provided document appears to be an OCR-parsed WeWork investor presentation from 2021, but the text extraction is incomplete with most content missing (showing only headers, bullet points, and page numbers). 

I searched for information regarding:
- Lease commitment durations
- Weighted average lease terms
- Lease maturity schedules
- Contractual obligations related to leases

None of these details are present in the extracted text. While the document does contain:
- A reference to WeWork's "All Access" subscription model (Page 25)
- Mentions of "traditional leased business" (Page 25)
- Various bullet points that may have contained financial data (Pages 22-23, 27, 37-38, 45-46)

The actual content of these sections was not successfully captured in the OCR process.

## Confidence: N/A

The document's text extraction is too limited to provide any meaningful analysis of lease commitment durations.

## Caveat

To properly answer this question, a complete OCR extraction or the original document would be needed, particularly sections that would typically contain:
- Commitments and contingencies notes
- Operating lease obligations tables
- Real estate portfolio details
