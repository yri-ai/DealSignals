# Answer to Question: What happens to the business at 50% occupancy?

**Not found in document.**

## Search Methodology
I conducted a comprehensive search for information about:
- The term "50% occupancy" or "50 percent occupancy"
- Business performance metrics at specific occupancy levels
- Break-even occupancy rates
- Financial impact of occupancy thresholds

## What the Document Contains
The document does mention occupancy in a general context:
- **Page 25** discusses "Drives Occupancy" as a benefit of the All Access product, noting it "Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections"

However, this reference does not provide specific information about what happens to the business at 50% occupancy or any other specific occupancy threshold.

## Confidence Level
**HIGH** - I am highly confident this specific information is not in the document, as the OCR-parsed content appears to be primarily headers, bullet points, and limited descriptive text, with most detailed content not captured in the OCR output.

## Caveat
The OCR parsing appears incomplete, showing mainly page headers, copyright notices, and bullet point markers without the full text content. The actual presentation likely contained detailed financial models or operational metrics that would address occupancy-level performance, but these are not visible in the provided OCR output.
