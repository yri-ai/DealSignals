# Analysis: Valuation Methodology

## Answer:
**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided OCR-parsed document appears to be heavily redacted or improperly parsed, containing primarily only copyright notices ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") and bullet points without accompanying text on most pages.

The few pages with readable content include:
- **Page 10**: Company values and mission statements
- **Page 24**: A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (no context provided)
- **Page 25**: Description of "All Access" product offering and its characteristics (partnerships, occupancy, margins)
- **Pages 45-46**: Lists of bullet points with some fragmentary references to metrics (divided by, etc.) but no complete sentences or valuation methodologies

## Confidence: HIGH

The document does not contain any identifiable valuation methodology such as:
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis
- Comparable company analysis
- Precedent transaction multiples
- Sum-of-the-parts valuation
- Net Asset Value calculations
- Price-to-earnings, EV/EBITDA, or other valuation multiples

## Caveats:
The document appears to be either heavily redacted or the OCR parsing failed to capture the actual content. A complete document with readable text would be necessary to identify any valuation methodology used to justify the SPAC merger price.
