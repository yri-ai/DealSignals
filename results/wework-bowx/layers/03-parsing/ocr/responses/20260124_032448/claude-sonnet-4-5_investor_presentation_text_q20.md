# Answer to Question: What comparable transactions or companies are cited?

## Finding:

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:

I conducted a thorough review of all 50 pages of this WeWork SPAC merger presentation document. The OCR-parsed content provided consists primarily of:
- Copyright notices (© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.) on every page
- Bullet points (indicated by • or ● symbols) without accompanying text
- Brief excerpts including:
  - Company values and mission statements (Page 10)
  - A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)
  - Description of "All Access" business model (Page 25)
  - References to footnotes (Page 35, Page 45)

The document does not contain any readable references to:
- Comparable public companies (comps)
- Precedent merger or acquisition transactions
- Industry peer comparisons
- Valuation multiples from other companies
- Similar SPAC transactions

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The confidence is high that this specific information is not present in the **parsed/readable portions** of the document provided.

## Caveats:
1. **OCR Parsing Quality**: The document appears to be heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed, with most substantive content appearing only as bullet point markers without accompanying text
2. **Missing Content**: If comparable transactions or companies were discussed, they would likely appear in sections that failed to parse properly
3. **Typical Placement**: In standard SPAC merger presentations, comps typically appear in valuation or market overview sections, which may exist but weren't captured in this OCR output
