It's possible that management compensation details existed in the original document but were not captured in this OCR parse. For complete due diligence, you would need to review:\n- The full proxy statement/S-4 filing\n- Employment agreements\n- The definitive merger agreement\n- Compensation discussion and analysis (CD&A) sections",
