In typical SPAC merger documentation, risk factors would normally be found in:\n- SEC filing documents (S-4, proxy statements)\n- Investor presentations with dedicated risk disclosure sections\n- Supplementary disclosure materials\n\nA complete due diligence review would require access to the full, properly parsed document or the original PDF.",
