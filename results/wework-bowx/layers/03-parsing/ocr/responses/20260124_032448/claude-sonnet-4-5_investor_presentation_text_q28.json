  "content": "# Going Concern Analysis\n\n**Answer:** Not found in document.\n\n**Explanation:** \nThe provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or business overview from 2021. I have reviewed all 50 pages of the OCR-parsed content, and there are no going concern disclosures present.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The document primarily contains company values (Page 10), business model descriptions (Page 25 discussing \"All Access\" subscription model), and various strategic content\n- Most pages contain only copyright notices: \"\u00a9 2021 WeWork. Confidential.\"\n- Pages with content focus on business operations, partnerships, and company culture\n- No financial statements, auditor reports, or management discussion sections are visible in the parsed text\n- No references to \"going concern,\" \"substantial doubt,\" \"liquidity risks,\" or similar terminology typically associated with going concern disclosures\n\n**Confidence:** HIGH\n\n**Caveat:** This analysis is limited by the OCR parsing quality. The document shows mostly copyright headers with minimal content extracted. If the original document contained financial statements or MD&A sections that failed to parse properly, going concern disclosures could be present but not captured in this OCR output. A going concern disclosure would typically appear in audited financial statements or SEC filings rather than a marketing/investor presentation.",
