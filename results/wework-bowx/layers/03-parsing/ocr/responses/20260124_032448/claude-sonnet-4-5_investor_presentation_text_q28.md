# Going Concern Analysis

**Answer:** Not found in document.

**Explanation:** 
The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation or business overview from 2021. I have reviewed all 50 pages of the OCR-parsed content, and there are no going concern disclosures present.

**Key Observations:**
- The document primarily contains company values (Page 10), business model descriptions (Page 25 discussing "All Access" subscription model), and various strategic content
- Most pages contain only copyright notices: "© 2021 WeWork. Confidential."
- Pages with content focus on business operations, partnerships, and company culture
- No financial statements, auditor reports, or management discussion sections are visible in the parsed text
- No references to "going concern," "substantial doubt," "liquidity risks," or similar terminology typically associated with going concern disclosures

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Caveat:** This analysis is limited by the OCR parsing quality. The document shows mostly copyright headers with minimal content extracted. If the original document contained financial statements or MD&A sections that failed to parse properly, going concern disclosures could be present but not captured in this OCR output. A going concern disclosure would typically appear in audited financial statements or SEC filings rather than a marketing/investor presentation.
