# Answer to Question: "What did the auditors say?"

**Not found in document.**

## Analysis:

I conducted a thorough review of all 50 pages of the provided document, and there is no mention of:
- Auditor opinions or reports
- Audit findings or concerns
- Auditor letters or statements
- Any references to independent auditors
- Audit-related disclosures

## Document Characteristics:

The document appears to be a WeWork corporate presentation dated 2021, containing:
- Company values and mission statements (Page 10)
- Business model information, including "All Access" product description (Page 25)
- Various bullet points and charts (timeline on Page 24 spanning 2010-2030)
- Metric definitions (Page 45)

However, it does **not** contain financial statements, audit opinions, or auditor commentary that would typically be found in:
- Form 10-K or 10-Q filings
- Proxy statements (DEF 14A)
- S-4 registration statements for SPAC mergers

## Confidence Level: **HIGH**

The absence of auditor information is directly observable from the document content provided.

## Recommendation:
For SPAC merger due diligence, you would need to request additional documents such as:
- Audited financial statements
- SEC registration statements (Form S-4)
- Independent auditor reports
