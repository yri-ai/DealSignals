# Analysis of Voting Structure Post-Merger

## Answer

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation

The provided document appears to be a WeWork investor presentation from 2021, likely related to their SPAC merger. However, the OCR-parsed version contains primarily header/footer information ("© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.") and bullet points without substantive text content on most pages.

I searched through all 50 pages for information regarding:
- Voting rights
- Share classes (Class A, Class B, etc.)
- Voting structure
- Post-merger governance
- Stockholder voting arrangements
- Dual-class structure

The only substantive content visible relates to:
- Company values and mission (Page 10)
- Product description of "All Access" offering (Page 25)
- Various bullet points without readable text (Pages 22, 23, 27, 37, 38, 45, 46)
- A timeline spanning 2010-2030 (Page 24)

## Confidence Rating

**N/A** - The information is not present in the document as provided.

## Caveats

The OCR parsing appears incomplete, as most pages only show copyright notices and bullet points without the actual text content. A complete version of this document would be necessary to answer questions about the voting structure post-merger.
