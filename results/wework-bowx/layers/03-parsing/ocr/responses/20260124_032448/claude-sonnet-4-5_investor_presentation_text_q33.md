# Answer to Question: What are the lock-up agreements?

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document does not contain any information about lock-up agreements. The OCR-parsed content appears to be primarily focused on WeWork's business model, values, and operations, including:
- Company values and mission (Page 10)
- Product offerings like "All Access" subscription model (Page 25)
- Various business metrics and operational details (scattered throughout)

Lock-up agreements, which typically restrict shareholders from selling their shares for a specified period following a SPAC merger, are not mentioned or discussed in any of the 50 pages provided.

## Confidence Level: 
**HIGH** - I have reviewed all 50 pages of the document and found no reference to lock-up agreements, lock-up periods, share sale restrictions, or related terms.

## Caveat:
The document appears to be incomplete or heavily redacted, as most pages contain only copyright notices and bullet points without substantive text content. Lock-up agreement details may exist in other transaction documents (such as the merger agreement, registration statement, or proxy statement) that were not provided.
