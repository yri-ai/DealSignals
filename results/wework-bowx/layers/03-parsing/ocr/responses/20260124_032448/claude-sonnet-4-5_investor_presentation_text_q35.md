# Market Context at Deal Time

**Not found in document.**

## Explanation:
The provided document appears to be a WeWork corporate presentation from 2021 (based on the copyright notices throughout), but the OCR parsing has failed to capture the actual text content from most pages. 

The document contains:
- Copyright notices on every page (© 2021 WeWork. Confidential)
- Bullet points without text on several pages (Pages 6, 9, 15, 22, 23, 27, 37, 38, 45, 46, 50)
- One page with company values/mission statements (Page 10)
- One page describing an "All Access" product offering (Page 25)
- A timeline graphic reference (Page 24: "2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030")

However, there is **no information** about:
- Market conditions at the time of the SPAC deal
- Economic environment
- Competitive landscape
- Industry trends
- Market sizing or growth rates
- Valuation context
- Comparable transactions

## Confidence: HIGH
I am highly confident that this specific information is not present in the provided document, though this appears to be due to incomplete OCR parsing rather than the absence of such content in the original presentation.

## Caveat:
The OCR parsing appears to have failed to extract most of the substantive content from this presentation, leaving only structural elements and copyright notices visible.
