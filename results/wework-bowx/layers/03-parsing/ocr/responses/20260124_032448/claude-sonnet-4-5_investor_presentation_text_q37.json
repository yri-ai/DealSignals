Confidential.\" and bullet points without accompanying text.\n2. **Limited Readable Content**: Only Pages 10 and 25 contain substantive readable text (company values and product descriptions), neither of which addresses lease obligations or exit strategies.\n3. **Missing Financial Details**: Financial strategy sections that would typically contain such information are not readable in this version.\n\n## Recommendation:\nA re-parsed or higher quality version of this document would be needed to properly answer questions about lease obligation strategies.",
