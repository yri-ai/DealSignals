# Post-Merger Integration or Business Model Changes

Based on my review of the provided document, I cannot identify specific post-merger integration plans or business model changes.

## What the Document Contains:

**Page 10** - Contains WeWork's core values and principles including:
- Operating with integrity and building trust
- Shared purpose and continuous improvement
- Bold action and courage
- Gratitude for people, members, and community
- Collaboration, kindness, and authenticity

**Page 25** - Describes WeWork's "All Access" business model:
- "On-Demand pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription that provides access to global network of locations"
- "Generates Partnerships" through affinity partnerships
- "Drives Occupancy" beyond physical capacity based on utilization projections
- "High Margins" through subscription-based model on traditional leased business

**Page 24** - Shows a timeline from 2010 to 2030 (no detail visible in OCR text)

## Answer:

**Not found in document**

The provided OCR-parsed document appears to be a presentation with mostly blank pages (many pages only show copyright notices). While it contains information about WeWork's values and existing business model (the All Access subscription offering), there are no explicit statements about:
- Post-SPAC merger integration plans
- Planned changes to the business model
- Operational restructuring
- Strategic pivots or modifications

**Confidence: HIGH** - The document genuinely lacks this information in the readable text.

**Caveat:** The OCR parsing may have failed to capture content from many pages, as most pages only show copyright notices and bullet points without text.
