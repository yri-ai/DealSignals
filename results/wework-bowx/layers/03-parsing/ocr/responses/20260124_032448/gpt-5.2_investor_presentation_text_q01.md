Not found in document. The provided OCR output contains no readable financial tables or figures stating WeWork’s revenue for any period; most pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and scattered bullet points without numeric revenue data (e.g., Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50). The only legible business content shown (e.g., “All Access” description) does not include revenue amounts (Page 25).

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct check of provided text; revenue figure not present).  
**Caveats/limitations:** The OCR appears incomplete/obscured for many pages (numerous bullets with missing text), so revenue could exist in the original document but is not captured in the provided OCR-parsed content (Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50).
