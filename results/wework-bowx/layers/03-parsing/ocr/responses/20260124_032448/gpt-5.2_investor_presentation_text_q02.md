**Not found in document.** The provided OCR pages do not include any revenue figures by year (or a table/chart with revenue for at least two years) needed to compute a year-over-year revenue growth rate. Most pages are only marked “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” (e.g., **Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50**) and the few pages with readable text (e.g., **Page 10** on values; **Page 25** describing “All Access”) do not contain revenue numbers or YoY growth.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (document lacks the necessary data).  

**Caveat / limitation:** The OCR appears incomplete/redacted for many pages (numerous bullets with no text, e.g., **Pages 6, 22–23, 45–46**), so the revenue data may exist in the original slides but is not captured in the provided OCR output.
