Operating losses for the most recent period: **Not found in document.**

- The OCR content provided does not include any financial statement line item or figure explicitly labeled “operating losses,” nor does it provide readable operating income/loss amounts for any period. Most pages contain only confidentiality footers and/or redacted bullet placeholders (e.g., pages **1–9, 11–23, 26–50**) with no legible operating loss figures.  
- The only clearly readable content relates to values/culture statements (page **10**) and a product description for “All Access” (page **25**), neither of which includes operating loss data.

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of operating loss figures in the provided OCR text)

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet symbols), so operating loss information may exist in the original source but is not recoverable from the provided text.
