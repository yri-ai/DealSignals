**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any figures for **current cash balance**, **cash burn rate (e.g., monthly/quarterly free cash flow or net cash used in operations)**, or an explicit **cash runway** calculation. Most pages contain only confidentiality marks and limited qualitative content (e.g., culture statements on **Page 10** and a brief product description on **Page 25**), with no financial metrics needed to compute runway.

- Evidence of missing financial data: **Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–44, 47–50** show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with no cash/burn figures; **Page 10** contains values/mission statements; **Page 25** discusses “All Access” benefits; **Pages 45–46** show redacted/bulleted content without readable numeric values.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the required inputs to compute runway are absent from the OCR-provided content).  

**Caveats/limitations:** The OCR appears heavily incomplete/redacted (many pages have only headers or bullet placeholders), so the runway may exist in the underlying slides but is **not recoverable from the provided text** (notably **Pages 45–46**).
