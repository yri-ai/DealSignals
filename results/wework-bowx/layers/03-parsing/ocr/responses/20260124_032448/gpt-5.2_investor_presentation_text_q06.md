**Path to profitability and timeline stated:** **Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR text does not include any explicit “path to profitability,” profitability bridge, margin expansion plan, or a stated profitability **timeline** (e.g., year/quarter for reaching EBITDA positive / net income positive). Most pages contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with limited readable content (e.g., values/culture statements on **p.10**; All Access product positioning on **p.25**; a timeline axis with years but no associated profitability milestones on **p.24**). **[Pages 10, 24–25]**

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The OCR appears severely incomplete/redacted (many pages have no readable substantive text, and several pages show only bullet placeholders), so profitability details may exist in the original document but are **not captured in the provided extract**. **[Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50]**

**Confidence:** **HIGH** (the provided text contains no stated profitability path or timeline).
