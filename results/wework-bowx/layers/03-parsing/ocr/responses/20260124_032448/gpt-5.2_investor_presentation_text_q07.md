Not found in document.

- The provided OCR text contains no section explicitly describing “key assumptions,” “projection assumptions,” “forecast assumptions,” or any numeric projection inputs (e.g., revenue growth rates, occupancy/utilization, pricing, margins, capex, churn, SG&A assumptions). Most pages are either blank/boilerplate (“© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.”) or contain non-financial narrative (e.g., values statements on **Page 10**) and a brief product description of “All Access” without quantified projection inputs (**Page 25**).  
- There is also no visible “Assumptions,” “Forecast,” “Outlook,” “Guidance,” or “Projections” table/footnote content in the OCR extract that could be used to derive assumptions (e.g., **Pages 45–46** show only bullet placeholders with missing text).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the assumptions are not present in the provided OCR-parsed content)

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The OCR appears incomplete/redacted for many pages (numerous pages show only confidentiality headers or bullet placeholders), so assumptions may exist in the original document but are not captured in the provided text (e.g., **Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50**).
