**Revenue per available desk/workstation:** **Not found in document.**

- The OCR text provided does not include any financial table or metric defining or quantifying “revenue per available desk/workstation.” Most pages contain only confidentiality footers and bullet placeholders, with no readable numeric disclosures for this metric (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50**).  
- The only legible business content captured relates to “All Access” and qualitative statements about margins/occupancy, but **no revenue-per-desk/workstation calculation or value** is shown (Page **25**, “All Access”).

**Confidence:** HIGH (document text does not contain the requested metric).  
**Caveat/limitation:** The document appears to be heavily truncated/garbled by OCR (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet symbols), so the metric may exist in the original file but is **not recoverable from the provided OCR output**.
