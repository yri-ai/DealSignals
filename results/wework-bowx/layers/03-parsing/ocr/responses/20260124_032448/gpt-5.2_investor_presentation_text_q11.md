**Member churn rate:** **Not found in document.**

- The OCR-parsed pages provided do not include any readable definition, metric value, or calculation for “member churn rate.” Most pages contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with limited legible content, and no section/header referencing churn (e.g., “Churn,” “Retention,” “Member churn rate”) appears in the extracted text (Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50**).  
- The only clearly legible business-metric-related content shown pertains to “All Access” (e.g., “High Margins,” “Drives Occupancy”), but it does **not** mention churn (Page **25**).

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly based on absence in provided OCR text)

**Caveat / limitation:** The document appears to be heavily OCR-degraded/redacted (many bullets with no text), so “member churn rate” may exist in the original slides but is not captured in the provided extracted text (Pages **6**, **9**, **15**, **22–23**, **27**, **37–38**, **45–46**, **50**).
