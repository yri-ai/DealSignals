**Average revenue per member:** Not found in document.

**Citations:** The provided OCR text contains no numeric revenue figures, no member counts, and no metric explicitly labeled “average revenue per member” (pages **1–50**, including the only partially legible business/metric content on pages **25** and **45**).

**Confidence:** **HIGH** (the metric is not present in the provided OCR-parsed content).

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The document appears to be heavily redacted/blank in the OCR output (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so the metric could exist in the original slides but is **not recoverable from the provided text** (pages **1–50**, notably **45–46** show placeholder bullets without values).
