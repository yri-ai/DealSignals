**Total lease obligations:** **Not found in document.**

- The OCR-parsed pages do not contain any numeric disclosure or table specifying “total lease obligations” (e.g., total future minimum lease payments/commitments). Most pages are either blank/confidential headers or bullet placeholders without figures (e.g., pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50).  
- The only substantive text visible relates to company values (page 10) and a product description of “All Access” (page 25), neither of which provides lease obligation amounts (pp. 10, 25).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document excerpt provided does not include the requested data).  
**Caveat/limitation:** This appears to be an incomplete/poorly OCR’d deck; key financial footnotes/tables that would normally disclose lease commitments may be missing or not captured by OCR (pages 45–46 show redacted/bulleted content without readable figures) (pp. 45–46).
