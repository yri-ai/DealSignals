**Duration profile of lease commitments:** **Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR text does not include any table, narrative, or schedule describing the *maturity / duration profile* of WeWork’s lease commitments (e.g., lease payments by year or by maturity buckets). Most pages are redacted/blank in OCR (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50** largely show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with no lease-commitment content).  
  **Citations:** Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50**.

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly absent from provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The OCR appears incomplete/redacted for many pages (bullets with no readable content on Pages **6**, **9**, **15**, **22–23**, **27**, **37–38**, **45–46**, **50**), so a lease maturity schedule could exist in the original document but is not captured in the provided OCR.  
  **Citations:** Pages **6**, **9**, **15**, **22–23**, **27**, **37–38**, **45–46**, **50**.
