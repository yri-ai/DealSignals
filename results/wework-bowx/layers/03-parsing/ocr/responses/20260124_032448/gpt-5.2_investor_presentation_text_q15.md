Lease termination provisions: **Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR pages do not contain any readable lease agreement language or a section describing termination rights, notice periods, penalties, early termination options, or related provisions. Most pages only show “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and/or bullet placeholders without substantive text (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50**).  
- The only clearly legible business content relates to company values (Page **10**) and a description of “All Access” (Page **25**), neither of which includes lease termination terms.

**Confidence:** HIGH (document does not include the relevant provisions in readable form)

**Caveats / limitations:** The OCR appears incomplete/redacted across many pages (numerous bullets with no text, e.g., Pages **6**, **15**, **22–23**, **37–38**, **45–46**, **50**), so lease termination provisions may exist in the source file but are **not captured/legible** in this parsed extract.
