**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any statement describing what happens to the business at **70% occupancy**. Most pages contain only confidentiality headers, bullet placeholders, or unrelated content (e.g., company values on **p.10** and “All Access” product attributes on **p.25**), with no explicit discussion of a 70% occupancy threshold or its business implications (**pp.1–50**, especially **p.25** for occupancy references but not 70%).  

**Confidence:** LOW (information is not present in the provided text).  

**Caveat / limitation:** The OCR appears incomplete/redacted across many pages (frequent “•” placeholders and missing text, e.g., **pp.6, 9, 15, 22–23, 45–46, 50**), so the relevant explanation may exist in the original document but is not captured in the provided OCR.
