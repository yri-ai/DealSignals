**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any statement or section describing what happens to the business at **50% occupancy** (e.g., profitability, cash burn, break-even, unit economics, or operational impacts). Most pages are redacted/blank in the OCR output, with only limited non-financial content visible (e.g., values on **p.10** and a high-level “All Access” description on **p.25**), and none mentions “50% occupancy.” **(Pages 1–50; specifically p.10, p.25)**

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly absent from provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:** The OCR appears incomplete/redacted across many pages (numerous pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet placeholders), so the underlying original document may contain the occupancy analysis, but it is **not available in the provided OCR-parsed extract**. **(Pages 1–50)**
