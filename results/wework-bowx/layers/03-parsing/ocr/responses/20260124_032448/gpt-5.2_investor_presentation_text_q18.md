**Implied enterprise value:** **Not found in document.**  

- The OCR text for all pages does not contain any enterprise value figure, valuation table, transaction summary, or “implied enterprise value” line item. Most pages only show “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with minimal readable content (e.g., cultural values on **Page 10**, product description on **Page 25**) and no valuation metrics (e.g., **Pages 1–9, 11–24, 26–50**).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly absent from provided OCR text)  

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed (many bullet points without text, and pages with only the confidentiality footer), so the enterprise value may exist in the original file but is not readable in the provided extract (e.g., **Pages 45–46** show bullet structures without legible numbers).
