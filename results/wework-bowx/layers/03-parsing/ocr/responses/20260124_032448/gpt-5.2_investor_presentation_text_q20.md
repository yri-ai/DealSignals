Not found in document. The provided OCR text contains no readable references to comparable transactions or comparable companies (e.g., peer set names, precedent M&A deals, or valuation comps). Most pages are either blank, contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.”, or show bullet placeholders without content (e.g., Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50). The only substantive readable content relates to values/culture (Page 10) and an “All Access” product description (Page 25), neither of which cites comps.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (explicit absence in provided text)  
**Caveat / limitation:** OCR appears severely incomplete/redacted across many pages (numerous bullets without text), so comparable transactions/companies may exist in the original document but are not captured in the provided OCR (Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50).
