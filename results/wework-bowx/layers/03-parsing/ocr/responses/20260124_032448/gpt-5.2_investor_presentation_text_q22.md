## SoftBank’s role and ongoing obligations

**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text contains no mention of **SoftBank**, nor does it describe **SoftBank’s role** in the transaction or any **ongoing obligations** (e.g., lock-ups, earnouts, PIPE/backstop commitments, governance rights, funding commitments, guarantees). The only legible content relates to WeWork values (Page 10) and a product description for “All Access” (Page 25); the remainder is largely redacted/empty bullets without SoftBank references (e.g., Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50).

### Caveats / limitations
- The document appears heavily **redacted or not properly OCR-parsed**, with many pages showing only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders (e.g., Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50). This significantly limits the ability to identify SoftBank-related terms or obligations.

**Confidence: HIGH** (SoftBank is not mentioned anywhere in the provided text; therefore role/obligations cannot be supported from this document).
