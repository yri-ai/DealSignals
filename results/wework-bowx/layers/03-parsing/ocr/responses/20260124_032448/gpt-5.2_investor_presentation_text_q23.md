## Related-party transactions identified
**Not found in document.** The OCR text provided does not include any disclosures or descriptions of related-party transactions (e.g., transactions with sponsors, founders, affiliates, executives, or significant shareholders). Most pages contain only the “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” footer and/or bullet placeholders without readable transaction details (e.g., Pages **1–9, 11–23, 26–50**; the only substantive readable content appears to be cultural statements on **Page 10** and a product description on **Page 25**, neither of which discusses related-party transactions).

## Caveats / limitations
- The document appears **heavily OCR-degraded**, with many pages showing only placeholders (“•”) and no legible content (e.g., **Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50**), so related-party transaction disclosures **could exist in the original** but are **not captured** in the provided text.

**Confidence: HIGH** (that related-party transactions are **not present in the provided OCR text**; not a statement about the original underlying document).
