## Management incentives/compensation in the deal
**Not found in document.** The provided OCR pages do not disclose management’s deal-related incentives or compensation (e.g., transaction bonuses, retention/rollover equity, earnouts, new employment agreements, SPAC sponsor promote allocations to management, or equity awards tied to closing). The pages are largely confidentiality notices, values statements, and high-level business descriptions without compensation terms (e.g., values on **Page 10**; All Access business model description on **Page 25**).

### Caveats / limitations
- The OCR text appears heavily incomplete/redacted across many pages (e.g., bullet-only pages such as **Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 45–46, 50**), which could mean compensation details exist in the original but are not captured in this extract.
- No section headers indicating “Management,” “Compensation,” “Incentives,” “Employment Agreements,” or similar are present in the provided text.

**Confidence: HIGH** (the document extract provided contains no explicit management incentive/compensation disclosures).
