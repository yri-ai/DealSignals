**Adam Neumann’s ongoing relationship/exposure:** **Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR text contains **no mention of “Adam Neumann”** and **no disclosures** describing any continuing role, ownership, governance rights, agreements, indemnities, related-party arrangements, or other ongoing exposure connected to him (Pages **1–50**, entire document as provided).  

**Confidence:** HIGH (directly based on absence of any reference in the provided document text)

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The OCR output appears **heavily redacted or missing content** on many pages (e.g., Pages **6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50** show bullets/placeholder symbols with little readable text), so relevant information **could exist in the original document but is not captured in this OCR extract**.
