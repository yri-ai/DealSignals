## Top disclosed risk factors
**Not found in document.**  

### Evidence / citations
- The provided OCR text does not include any “Risk Factors” section, risk-factor headings, or readable risk-factor statements. Most pages only show “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with bullets or redacted/blank content (e.g., pages **1–9, 11–23, 26–50**).
- The only legible narrative content appears to be **company values/culture statements** (page **10**) and a **product description of “All Access”** (page **25**), neither of which discloses risk factors.

## Caveats / limitations
- **Severe OCR loss / redaction:** Many pages contain only confidentiality footer text and unreadable bullets, indicating the risk-factor content may exist in the underlying document but is **not captured in the provided OCR extract** (pages **6, 9, 15, 22–23, 27, 37–38, 45–46, 50** show bullets without readable text).
- Without readable risk-factor text, no reliable identification or ranking of “top disclosed risk factors” is possible based solely on this document.

**Confidence: HIGH** (the absence of risk-factor text is directly observable in the provided document).
