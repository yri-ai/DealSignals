**Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR text does not include any explicit **“going concern”** language, auditor’s going concern emphasis, or disclosures about substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The pages shown are largely confidentiality footers and high-level narrative content (e.g., values on **Page 10**), with no financial statement footnotes or audit report excerpts.

**Confidence:** LOW (based on absence in the provided OCR text, but the document appears heavily truncated/garbled).  

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The OCR output is severely incomplete across most pages (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet placeholders), so a going concern disclosure could exist in sections not captured by OCR or omitted from the extract (e.g., financial statements, MD&A, or footnotes not present in the text).
