**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any auditor’s report, auditor opinion, or statements attributable to auditors. Most pages only show “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with minimal additional content (e.g., values statements on **Page 10**), and no section header or page contains audit commentary.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document text provided contains no auditor statements).  

**Caveats / limitations:** The OCR appears highly incomplete/redacted (many pages contain only confidentiality marks or bullet placeholders), so an auditor statement may exist in the original source but is **not captured in the provided text** (e.g., **Pages 1–9, 11–50** largely lack substantive readable content).
