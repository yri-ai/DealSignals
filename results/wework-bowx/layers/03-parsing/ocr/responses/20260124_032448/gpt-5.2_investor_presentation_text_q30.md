**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any disclosure or discussion of **material weaknesses in internal controls** (e.g., “material weakness,” “internal control over financial reporting (ICFR),” “SOX 404,” or auditor/management control conclusions). The pages are largely blank/redacted in the OCR output or contain general corporate statements, with no internal-control section visible (e.g., only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” on most pages such as **Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–44, 47–49**, and limited non-controls content on **Pages 10, 24–25, 45–46, 50**).

**Confidence:** LOW (absence-of-evidence; document content appears incomplete/mostly redacted in OCR).

**Caveats / limitations:** The OCR-parsed document is heavily truncated/redacted (many pages contain only confidentiality footers and bullet placeholders), so an internal-controls discussion could exist in the original deck but is not captured here (see pervasive missing content across **Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–44, 47–49**).
