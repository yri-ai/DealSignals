**Voting structure post-merger:** **Not found in document.**  

- The OCR text provided does not include any description of post-merger share classes, voting rights (e.g., one-share-one-vote vs. dual-class), founder/sponsor voting arrangements, or any governance/voting provisions. Most pages contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with minimal readable content (e.g., general values language on **p.10** and a product description on **p.25**), and none mention voting structure (**pp.1–50**, including **p.10**, **p.25**).

**Confidence:** HIGH (the document text provided does not contain the requested information).  

**Caveats / limitations:** The document appears to be heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed (many pages contain only the confidentiality footer and bullet placeholders), so relevant voting-structure details may exist in the original source but are not captured in the provided text (**pp.1–50**).
