**Lock-up agreements:** **Not found in document.**

- The OCR text provided contains no readable section describing lock-up terms (e.g., sponsor lock-up, founder shares, PIPE investor lock-ups, earnout-related restrictions, or transfer restrictions). Most pages are either blank/confidential placeholders or heavily redacted bullets without lock-up language (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50** show “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with minimal/indecipherable content; Page **10** contains company values, not transaction terms).  

**Confidence:** **HIGH** (the provided OCR text does not include any lock-up details).  
**Caveat/limitation:** The document appears severely OCR-limited/redacted (many pages contain only confidentiality marks or bullet placeholders), so lock-up agreements may exist in the original source but are **not captured in the provided text** (Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–50**).
