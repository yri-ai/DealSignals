**Registration rights**: **Not found in document.** The provided OCR text contains no section or language describing **registration rights**, **demand/piggyback registration**, **shelf registration**, **lock-up/registration timing**, or similar terms. Pages shown are largely confidentiality footers and high-level narrative content (e.g., values on **Page 10**) with no relevant legal/transaction terms.

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of any registration-rights language in the provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:**  
- The OCR appears highly incomplete for many pages (e.g., many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet placeholders without substantive text), which could mean registration rights exist in the underlying document but were not captured in the OCR (e.g., **Pages 1–9, 11–49**).
