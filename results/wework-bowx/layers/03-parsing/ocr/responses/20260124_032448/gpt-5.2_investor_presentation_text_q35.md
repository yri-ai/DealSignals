## Market context at deal time
**Not found in document.** The provided OCR text does not include any explicit discussion of “market context,” macro/industry conditions, capital markets/SPAC market environment, or comparable transaction/valuation environment at the time of the deal. Most pages are either blank/boilerplate confidentiality marks (e.g., Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–44, 47–50) or contain non-market content such as company values (Page 10) and a product description for “All Access” (Page 25).  

### Caveats / limitations
- The OCR appears severely incomplete (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so any market-context section may exist in the original but is **not captured** in the provided text (Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–44, 47–50).
- A timeline axis is visible but unlabeled (Page 24) and does not describe market conditions.

**Confidence: HIGH** (based on absence of market-context information in the provided document text).
