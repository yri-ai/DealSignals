Comparable transactions disclosure: **Not found in document**.

- Across the provided OCR text, there are no sections/tables describing **comparable M&A/SPAC transactions**, precedent transaction multiples, or a list of comparable deals. Most pages contain only confidentiality footers or bullet placeholders without transaction detail (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–23**, **26–49**), and the few readable content pages (e.g., **Page 10** on company values; **Page 25** on “All Access” product) do not mention comparable transactions.

**Confidence:** HIGH (the provided text does not disclose any comparable transactions)

**Caveat / limitation:** The document appears **heavily redacted or poorly OCR-parsed** (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” or bullet points without readable content, e.g., **Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–49**). Comparable transactions could exist in the original source but are **not visible in the provided OCR text**.
