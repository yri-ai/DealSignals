**Exit/refinancing strategy for the lease obligations:** **Not found in document.**

- The provided OCR pages do not contain any explicit discussion of an **exit strategy**, **refinancing plan**, **lease liability refinancing**, **lease buyouts/terminations**, or any structured approach to addressing **lease obligations** (e.g., via renegotiation, asset sales, financing facilities, or securitization). This includes the only partially legible bullet pages (e.g., Pages **6, 15, 22–23, 37–38, 45–46, 50**) and the “All Access” business model description (Page **25**), none of which mentions lease obligation refinancing/exit.  

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct absence of relevant information in the provided text)

**Caveats / limitations:**
- The OCR output is heavily redacted/blank across most pages (many pages show only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and bullet placeholders), so relevant content may exist in the original slides but is **not available in the provided OCR text** (Pages **1–9, 11–23, 26–50**).
