## Planned post‑merger integration or business model changes (from provided document)

- **Shift/expansion toward an “All Access” subscription and on‑demand model**: The document describes **“All Access”** as an *“On-Demand pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription that provides access to [a] global network of locations”* (Page 25, section titled **“All Access”**). This indicates a planned business model expansion beyond purely traditional leased office memberships into subscription/on‑demand access.

- **Use All Access to change demand generation and occupancy management**:
  - **Partnership-led demand generation**: *“Affinity partnerships generate top of funnel demand”* (Page 25, bullet **“Generates Partnerships”**).
  - **Portfolio-level utilization/occupancy optimization beyond physical capacity**: *“Allows WeWork to drive occupancy beyond physical capacity levels across portfolio based on utilization projections”* (Page 25, bullet **“Drives Occupancy”**). This suggests an operational model change toward utilization-based capacity planning across locations.

- **Targeting higher incremental margins through the subscription layer**: The document states *“Significant incremental margins given subscription-based model on top of traditional leased business”* (Page 25, bullet **“High Margins”**), implying an intended mix shift toward a higher-margin subscription product layered on the existing model.

## What is **not found in the document**
- **Explicit post-merger integration plans** (e.g., org integration, systems/IT integration, headcount integration, integration timeline, governance, synergy targets) — **Not found in document** (no relevant detail beyond the All Access business model description; most pages are redacted/blank or contain only confidentiality marks, e.g., Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50).

## Confidence & caveats
- **Confidence: MEDIUM.** The “All Access” model and its intended effects are **directly stated** (Page 25), but the question asks specifically about *post‑merger integration*; the document does **not** explicitly tie these changes to a merger integration plan or provide broader integration detail.
- **Caveat:** The OCR content is highly incomplete/redacted across most pages, so additional planned integration/business model changes may exist in the original but are **not observable** here (Pages 1–9, 11–23, 26–50 largely contain no substantive text).
