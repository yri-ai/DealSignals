## Debt covenants and restrictions

**Not found in document.** The OCR-parsed pages provided do not contain any readable disclosure of **debt covenants** (e.g., leverage/coverage ratios, minimum liquidity, reporting requirements) or **debt-related restrictions** (e.g., limits on additional indebtedness, liens, dividends/distributions, investments, asset sales, change-of-control provisions). Most pages are either redacted/blank (“© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.”) or contain non-financial narrative content (e.g., values statement on **Page 10**) and high-level product/strategy text (e.g., “All Access” description on **Page 25**) without covenant terms.  

**Citations:** Pages **1–9, 11–23, 26–50** show no readable covenant language beyond confidentiality/placeholder bullets; **Page 10** contains cultural values text; **Page 25** contains an “All Access” business description, not financing terms.

### Caveats / limitations
- The document appears **heavily redacted or not successfully OCR’d** (many pages contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” and/or bullet placeholders), so covenant details may exist in the original but are **not recoverable from the provided text** (e.g., **Pages 6, 9, 15, 22–23, 45–46, 50** show bullet placeholders without content).

**Confidence: HIGH** (directly based on absence of covenant information in the provided OCR text).
