## Investment view (based only on this document)
**Not enough information to make an investment decision; I would not invest based on this document alone.**  
**Reason:** The document is overwhelmingly non-financial/marketing content and does not provide the minimum quantitative diligence inputs (transaction terms, historical financials, projections, cash needs, unit economics, key risks, governance) required to underwrite a SPAC merger.  
- Many pages contain only “© 2021 WeWork. Confidential.” with no substantive content (e.g., Pages **1–9**, **11–14**, **16–21**, **26**, **28–34**, **36**, **39–44**, **47–49**).  
- The only clearly legible substantive business content relates to company values (Page **10**) and a product description for “All Access” (Page **25**).  
- Later pages show mostly redacted bullets and a partial formula/definition that is unreadable in substance (Pages **45–46**), and the final page contains only bullets with no readable detail (Page **50**).

## What *is* disclosed that could support a thesis (limited)
- **Strategic/product narrative:** “All Access” is described as (i) on-demand/subscription access to a global location network, (ii) generating partnerships, (iii) driving occupancy beyond physical capacity via utilization projections, and (iv) having “high margins” due to incremental subscription economics (Page **25**).  
  - Caveat: These are qualitative claims; no margins, adoption metrics, retention, CAC, churn, or financial impact are provided (Page **25**).

- **Culture/values statements:** The deck includes statements about integrity, collaboration, resilience, and community (Page **10**).  
  - Caveat: Values do not substitute for financial underwriting (Page **10**).

## Critical diligence items missing (therefore “Not found in document”)
The document does **not** provide (Not found in document):
- **SPAC deal terms:** valuation, cash proceeds, PIPE, redemptions sensitivity, sponsor promote, earnouts (Not found in document).
- **Historical financial statements:** revenue, gross margin, EBITDA/Adjusted EBITDA, net income/loss, cash flow, balance sheet, liquidity runway (Not found in document).
- **Forecasts/projections:** revenue growth, margin expansion, capex, free cash flow, break-even timing (Not found in document).
- **Unit economics & KPIs:** occupancy, RevPA (or equivalent), member growth, churn, cohort performance, location-level profitability (Not found in document).
- **Lease obligations and risk:** lease maturities, fixed vs variable costs, renegotiation assumptions (Not found in document).
- **Risk factors/legal/regulatory:** litigation, related-party transactions, governance controls (Not found in document).

## Conclusion
Given the absence of investable financial and transaction information, **I would not invest based on this document alone** (Pages **1–9**, **11–14**, **16–21**, **26**, **28–34**, **36**, **39–44**, **47–49** show no usable diligence content; limited qualitative content on Pages **10** and **25**).

### Confidence: **HIGH**
Because the conclusion is driven by what is directly observable: the document does not contain the necessary financial/transaction details to make an investment decision (see page citations above).

### Key caveat/limitation
This appears to be an **incomplete and/or heavily redacted OCR extract**; important data may exist in the original slides but is **not readable here** (notably Pages **45–46**, **50**).
